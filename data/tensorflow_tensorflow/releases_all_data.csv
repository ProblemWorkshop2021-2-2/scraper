    "body": "# Release 2.5.0\r\n\r\n## Major Features and Improvements\r\n\r\n* Support for Python3.9 has been added.\r\n* `tf.data`:\r\n    *   `tf.data` service now supports strict round-robin reads, which is useful for synchronous training workloads where example sizes vary. With strict round robin reads, users can guarantee that consumers get similar-sized examples in the same step.\r\n    *   tf.data service now supports optional compression. Previously data would always be compressed, but now you can disable compression by passing `compression=None` to `tf.data.experimental.service.distribute(...)`.\r\n    *   `tf.data.Dataset.batch()` now supports `num_parallel_calls` and `deterministic` arguments. `num_parallel_calls` is used to indicate that multiple input batches should be computed in parallel. With `num_parallel_calls` set, `deterministic` is used to indicate that outputs can be obtained in the non-deterministic order.\r\n    *   Options returned by `tf.data.Dataset.options()` are no longer mutable.\r\n    *   tf.data input pipelines can now be executed in debug mode, which disables any asynchrony, parallelism, or non-determinism and forces Python execution (as opposed to trace-compiled graph execution) of user-defined functions passed into transformations such as `map`. The debug mode can be enabled through `tf.data.experimental.enable_debug_mode()`.\r\n* `tf.lite`\r\n    *   Enabled the new MLIR-based quantization backend by default\r\n        *   The new backend is used for 8 bits full integer post-training quantization\r\n        *   The new backend removes the redundant rescales and fixes some bugs (shared weight/bias, extremely small scales, etc)\r\n        *   Set `experimental_new_quantizer` in tf.lite.TFLiteConverter to False to disable this change\r\n* `tf.keras`\r\n    * `tf.keras.metrics.AUC` now support logit predictions.\r\n    *   Enabled a new supported input type in `Model.fit`, `tf.keras.utils.experimental.DatasetCreator`, which takes a callable, `dataset_fn`. `DatasetCreator` is intended to work across all `tf.distribute` strategies, and is the only input type supported for Parameter Server strategy.\r\n* `tf.distribute`\r\n    *   `tf.distribute.experimental.ParameterServerStrategy` now supports training with Keras `Model.fit` when used with `DatasetCreator`.\r\n    * Creating `tf.random.Generator` under `tf.distribute.Strategy` scopes is now allowed (except for `tf.distribute.experimental.CentralStorageStrategy` and `tf.distribute.experimental.ParameterServerStrategy`). Different replicas will get different random-number streams.\r\n* TPU embedding support\r\n    * Added `profile_data_directory` to `EmbeddingConfigSpec` in `_tpu_estimator_embedding.py`. This allows embedding lookup statistics gathered at runtime to be used in embedding layer partitioning decisions.\r\n* PluggableDevice\r\n    * Third-party devices can now connect to TensorFlow as plug-ins through [StreamExecutor C API](https://github.com/tensorflow/community/blob/master/rfcs/20200612-stream-executor-c-api.md).\r\nand [PluggableDevice](https://github.com/tensorflow/community/blob/master/rfcs/20200624-pluggable-device-for-tensorflow.md) interface.\r\n      * Add custom ops and kernels through [kernel and op registration C API](https://github.com/tensorflow/community/blob/master/rfcs/20190814-kernel-and-op-registration.md).\r\n      * Register custom graph optimization passes with [graph optimization C API](https://github.com/tensorflow/community/blob/master/rfcs/20201027-modular-tensorflow-graph-c-api.md).\r\n* [oneAPI Deep Neural Network Library (oneDNN)](https://github.com/oneapi-src/oneDNN) CPU performance optimizations from [Intel-optimized TensorFlow](https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/articles/intel-optimization-for-tensorflow-installation-guide.html) are now available in the official x86-64 Linux and Windows builds.\r\n    * They are off by default. Enable them by setting the environment variable `TF_ENABLE_ONEDNN_OPTS=1`.\r\n    * We do not recommend using them in GPU systems, as they have not been sufficiently tested with GPUs yet.\r\n* TensorFlow pip packages are now built with CUDA11.2 and cuDNN 8.1.0      \r\n      \r\n## Breaking Changes\r\n\r\n* The `TF_CPP_MIN_VLOG_LEVEL` environment variable has been renamed to to `TF_CPP_MAX_VLOG_LEVEL` which correctly describes its effect.\r\n\r\n## Bug Fixes and Other Changes\r\n\r\n*   `tf.keras`:\r\n    *   Preprocessing layers API consistency changes:\r\n        *   `StringLookup` added `output_mode`, `sparse`, and `pad_to_max_tokens` arguments with same semantics as `TextVectorization`.\r\n        *   `IntegerLookup` added `output_mode`, `sparse`, and `pad_to_max_tokens` arguments with same semantics as `TextVectorization`. Renamed `max_values`, `oov_value` and `mask_value` to `max_tokens`, `oov_token` and `mask_token` to align with `StringLookup` and `TextVectorization`.\r\n        *   `TextVectorization` default for `pad_to_max_tokens` switched to False.\r\n        *   `CategoryEncoding` no longer supports `adapt`, `IntegerLookup` now supports equivalent functionality. `max_tokens` argument renamed to `num_tokens`.\r\n        *   `Discretization` added `num_bins` argument for learning bins boundaries through calling `adapt` on a dataset. Renamed `bins` argument to `bin_boundaries` for specifying bins without `adapt`.\r\n    *   Improvements to model saving/loading:\r\n        *   `model.load_weights` now accepts paths to saved models.\r\n    *   Keras inputs can now be created directly from arbitrary `tf.TypeSpecs`.\r\n    *   Two new learning rate schedules added: `tf.keras.optimizers.schedules.CosineDecay` and`tf.keras.optimizers.schedules.CosineDecayRestarts`.\r\n\r\n*   `tf.data`:\r\n    *   Exposing `tf.data.experimental.ExternalStatePolicy`, which can be used to control how external state should be handled during dataset serialization or iterator checkpointing.\r\n    *   Changing `tf.data.experimental.save` to store the type specification of the dataset elements. This avoids the need for explicitly specifying the `element_spec` argument of `tf.data.experimental.load` when loading the previously saved dataset.\r\n    *   Add `.element_spec` property to `tf.data.DatasetSpec` to access the inner spec. This can be used to extract the structure of nested\r\n        datasets.\r\n    *   Add `tf.data.experimental.AutoShardingPolicy.HINT` which can be used to provide hints to tf.distribute-based auto-sharding as to where in the input pipeline to insert sharding transformations.\r\n    *   Make tf.data.Options persistent across `tf.function` and `GraphDef` boundaries.\r\n        \r\n*   XLA compilation:\r\n    *   `tf.function(experimental_compile=True)` has become a stable API, renamed `tf.function(jit_compile=True)`.\r\n    *   XLA can now compile MirroredStrategy: the step function passed to`strategy.run` can now be annoted with `jit_compile=True`.\r\n\r\n*   `tf.distribute`:\r\n    *   Rename `experimental_prefetch_to_device` in `tf.distribute.InputOptions` to `experimental_fetch_to_device` to better reflect the purpose.\r\n\r\n*   `tf.lite`:\r\n    *   class `tflite::Subgraph`:\r\n        *   Removed the `tensors()` method and the non-const overload of the `nodes_and_registration()` method, both of which were previously documented as temporary and to be removed.\r\n            *   Uses of `tensors()` can be replaced by calling the existing methods `tensors_size()` and `tensor(int)`.\r\n            *   Uses of the non-const overload of `nodes_and_registration` can be replaced by calling the existing methods `nodes_size()` and `context()`, and then calling the `GetNodeAndRegistration` method in the `TfLiteContext` returned by `context()`.\r\n    *   NNAPI\r\n        *   Removed deprecated `Interpreter::UseNNAPI(bool)` C++ API.\r\n            *   Use `NnApiDelegate()` and related delegate configuration methods directly.\r\n        *  Replaced the model cache key for models computation algorithm with one guaranteed to be stable across runs.\r\n    *  16 bits quantization\r\n        *   Added int16x8 support for ABS, REDUCE_MAX and REDUCE_MIN operators.\r\n        *   Additional tests and fixes for ADD and SUB operators.\r\n    *  Added support for saved model's session initializer through `TFLiteConverter.from_saved_model`.\r\n    *  Added DEPTH_TO_SPACE support in Post training quantization.\r\n    *  Added dynamic range quantization support for the BatchMatMul op.\r\n        * Both symmetric and asymmetric quantized input tensor are supported.\r\n    *  Add `RFFT2D` as builtin op. (`RFFT2D` also supports `RFFTD`.) Currently only supports float32 input.\r\n    *  Add 5D support to `SLICE` op.\r\n    *  TFLite Supports SingatureDef:\r\n        * TFLiteConverter exports models with SignatureDef\r\n        * Interpreter supports getting a list of signatures and getting callable function for a given signaturedef.\r\n    *  Add int8 support for `ReshapeV2`.\r\n    *  Add experimental support for optimization with sparsity.\r\n    *  Add nominal support for unsigned 32-bit integer tensor types. Note that very few TFLite kernels support this type natively, so its use in mobile ML authoring is generally discouraged.\r\n    *  Add support for static hash tables through `TFLiteConverter.from_saved_model`.\r\n    *  The Python TF Lite Interpreter bindings now has an option `experimental_preserve_all_tensors` to aid in debugging conversion.\r\n    *  Quantized x86 execution defaults to Ruy GEMM library for platforms with AVX support.\r\n    *  Deprecate `tf.compat.v1.lite.experimental.get_potentially_supported_ops`. Use `tf.lite.TFLiteConverter` directly to check whether a model is convertible.\r\n    * Add support to select one of three different built-in op resolvers\r\n    *  Enabled post training with calibrations for models that require user provided TensorFlow Lite custom op libraries via `converter.target_spec._experimental_custom_op_registerers`. used in Python Interpreter API.\r\n*   TF Core:\r\n    *   Corrected higher-order gradients of control flow constructs (`tf.cond`, `tf.while_loop`, and compositions like `tf.foldl`) computed with `tf.GradientTape` inside a `tf.function`.\r\n    *   Changed the default step size in `gradient_checker_v2.compute_gradients` to be exactly representable as a binary floating point numbers. This avoids poluting gradient approximations needlessly, which is some cases leads to false negatives in op gradient tests.\r\n    * Added `tf.config.experimental.get_memory_info`, returning a dict with the current and peak memory usage. Deprecated `tf.config.experimental.get_memory_usage` in favor of this new function.\r\n    *   Extended `tf.config.experimental.enable_tensor_float_32_execution` to control Tensor-Float-32 evaluation in RNNs.\r\n    *   Added a 'experimental_payloads' field to tf.errors.OpError and its subclasses to support more detailed error reporting. This is inspired from Abseil Status payloads: https://github.com/abseil/abseil-cpp/blob/master/absl/status/status.h\r\n\r\n*   `tf.summary`:\r\n    *   New `tf.summary.graph` allows manual write of TensorFlow graph (`tf.Graph` or `tf.compat.v1.GraphDef`) as a summary. This is not a replacement for the trace-based API.\r\n\r\n*   Set `/d2ReducedOptimizeHugeFunctions` by default for Windows builds. This provides a big compile-time speedup, and effectively raises the minimum supported MSVC version to 16.4 (current: 16.8).\r\n    *   See: https://groups.google.com/a/tensorflow.org/d/topic/build/SsW98Eo7l3o/discussion\r\n\r\n*   TensorRT\r\n    *   Removed the deprecated `session_config` parameter for the TF1-TRT converter `TrtGraphConverter`. Previously, we issued a warning when the value of the parameter is not None.\r\n    *   The TF2-TRT converter `TrtGraphConverterV2` takes an object of class TrtConversionParams as a parameter. Removed three deprecated fields from this class: `rewriter_config_template`, `is_dynamic_op`, and `max_batch_size`. Previously, we issued a warning when the value of `rewriter_config_template` is not None. We issued an error when the value of `is_dynamic_op` is not True. We didn't use the value for `max_batch_size` for building TensorRT engines. Add parameters `use_dynamic_shape` to enable dynamic shape support. The default is to disable dynamic shape support. Add `dynamic_shape_profile_strategy` for selecting a dynamic shape profile strategy. The default is profile strategy is `Range`.\r\n    *   Issue a warning when function get_tensorrt_rewriter_config is used.\r\n\r\n*   TF XLA\r\n    *   Add new enum value `MLIR_BRIDGE_ROLLOUT_SAFE_MODE_ENABLED` to `tf.config.experimental.mlir_bridge_rollout` to enable a \\\"safe\\\" mode. This runs the MLIR bridge only when an analysis of the graph only when an analysis of the graph determines that it is safe to run.\r\n    *   Add new enum value `MLIR_BRIDGE_ROLLOUT_SAFE_MODE_FALLBACK_ENABLED' to `tf.config.experimental.mlir_bridge_rollout` to enable a fallback for the MLIR bridge in a \\\"safe\\\" mode. This runs the MLIR bridge in a FallbackEnabled mode when an analysis of the graph determines that the graph does not have unsupported features.\r\n*   Deterministic Op Functionality:\r\n    *   Add determinism-unimplemented exception-throwing to the segment-sum ops. When the environment variable `TF_DETERMINISTIC_OPS` is set to `\"true\"` or `\"1\"` (when op-determinism is expected), an attempt to run the following ops on a GPU will throw `tf.errors.UnimplementedError` (with an understandable message) when `data` is a floating-point type, including complex types (if supported): `tf.math.segment_prod`, `tf.math.segment_sum`, `tf.math.unsorted_segment_mean`, `tf.math.unsorted_segment_sqrt_n`, `tf.math.unsorted_segment_prod`, `tf.math.unsorted_segment_sum`, and therefore also `tf.convert_to_tensor` when `value` is of type `tf.IndexedSlices` (such as in the back prop though `tf.gather` into a dense embedding). See issue [39751](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/39751) which this change addresses, but does not solve. This exception-throwing  behavior can be disabled by setting the environment variable `TF_DISABLE_SEGMENT_REDUCTION_OP_DETERMINISM_EXCEPTIONS` to `\"true\"` or\r\n`\"1\"`. For more information about these changes, see the description in pull request [47772](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/pull/47772).\r\n    *   In previous versions of TensorFlow, when a GPU was available, `tf.sparse.sparse_dense_matmul` introduced truly random noise in the  forward path for data of type `tf.float32` but not for data of type `tf.float64` (for which there was no GPU implementation). In this  current release, GPU support for other floating-point types (`tf.float16`, `tf.float64`, `tf.complex64`, and `tf.complex128`) has been added for this op. If you were relying on the determinism of the `tf.float64` CPU implementation being automatically selected because of the absence of the `tf.float64` GPU implementation, you with either need to force the op to run on the CPU or use a different data type.\r\n* Security\r\n    * Fixes a heap buffer overflow in `RaggedBinCount`

    "body": "# Release 2.5.0\r\n\r\n* Support for Python3.9 has been added.\r\n* PluggableDevice\r\n    * Third-party devices can now connect to TensorFlow [modularly](https://github.com/tensorflow/community/blob/master/rfcs/20190305-modular-tensorflow.md) through [StreamExecutor C API](https://github.com/tensorflow/community/blob/master/rfcs/20200612-stream-executor-c-api.md). and [PluggableDevice](https://github.com/tensorflow/community/blob/master/rfcs/20200624-pluggable-device-for-tensorflow.md) interface.\r\n      * Add custom ops and kernels through [kernel and op registration C API](https://github.com/tensorflow/community/blob/master/rfcs/20190814-kernel-and-op-registration.md).\r\n      * Register custom graph optimization passes with [graph optimization C API](https://github.com/tensorflow/community/blob/master/rfcs/20201027-modular-tensorflow-graph-c-api.md).\r\n* `tf.data`:\r\n    *   tf.data service now supports strict round-robin reads, which is useful for synchronous training workloads where example sizes vary. With strict round robin reads, users can guarantee that consumers get similar-sized examples in the same step.\r\n    *   tf.data service now supports optional compression. Previously data would always be compressed, but now you can disable compression by passing `compression=None` to `tf.data.experimental.service.distribute(...)`.\r\n    *   `tf.data.Dataset.batch()` now supports `num_parallel_calls` and `deterministic` arguments. `num_parallel_calls` is used to indicate that multiple input batches should be computed in parallel. With `num_parallel_calls` set, `deterministic` is used to indicate that outputs can be obtained in the non-deterministic order.\r\n    *   Options returned by `tf.data.Dataset.options()` are no longer mutable.\r\n    *   tf.data input pipelines can now be executed in debug mode, which disables any asynchrony, parallelism, or non-determinism and forces Python execution (as opposed to trace-compiled graph execution) of user-defined functions passed into transformations such as `map`. The debug mode can be enabled through `tf.data.experimental.enable_debug_mode()`.\r\n* `tf.lite`\r\n    *   Enabled the new MLIR-based quantization backend by default\r\n        *   The new backend is used for 8 bits full integer post-training quantization\r\n        *   The new backend removes the redundant rescales and fixes some bugs (shared weight/bias, extremely small scales, etc)\r\n        *   Set `experimental_new_quantizer` in tf.lite.TFLiteConverter to False to disable this change\r\n* `tf.keras`\r\n    * `tf.keras.metrics.AUC` now support logit predictions.\r\n    *  Enabled a new supported input type in `Model.fit`, `tf.keras.utils.experimental.DatasetCreator`, which takes a callable, `dataset_fn`. `DatasetCreator` is intended to work across all `tf.distribute` strategies, and is the only input type supported for Parameter Server strategy.\r\n* `tf.distribute`\r\n    * Creating `tf.random.Generator` under `tf.distribute.Strategy` scopes is now allowed (except for `tf.distribute.experimental.CentralStorageStrategy` and `tf.distribute.experimental.ParameterServerStrategy`). Different replicas will get different random-number streams. \r\n    * `tf.distribute.experimental.ParameterServerStrategy` now supports training with Keras `Model.fit` when used with `DatasetCreator`.\r\n* [oneAPI Deep Neural Network Library (oneDNN)](https://github.com/oneapi-src/oneDNN) CPU performance optimizations from [Intel-optimized TensorFlow](https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/articles/intel-optimization-for-tensorflow-installation-guide.html) are now available in the official x86-64 Linux and Windows builds.\r\n    * They are off by default. Enable them by setting the environment variable `TF_ENABLE_ONEDNN_OPTS=1`.\r\n    * We do not recommend using them in GPU systems, as they have not been sufficiently tested with GPUs yet.\r\n* TensorFlow pip packages are now built with CUDA11.2 and cuDNN 8.1.0  \r\n* TPU embedding support\r\n  * Added `profile_data_directory` to `EmbeddingConfigSpec` in `_tpu_estimator_embedding.py`. This allows embedding lookup statistics gathered at runtime to be used in embedding layer partitioning decisions.    \r\n      \r\n## Breaking Changes\r\n\r\n* The `TF_CPP_MIN_VLOG_LEVEL` environment variable has been renamed to to `TF_CPP_MAX_VLOG_LEVEL` which correctly describes its effect.\r\n\r\n## Bug Fixes and Other Changes\r\n\r\n*   `tf.keras`:\r\n    *   Preprocessing layers API consistency changes:\r\n        *   `StringLookup` added `output_mode`, `sparse`, and `pad_to_max_tokens` arguments with same semantics as `TextVectorization`.\r\n        *   `IntegerLookup` added `output_mode`, `sparse`, and `pad_to_max_tokens` arguments with same semantics as `TextVectorization`. Renamed `max_values`, `oov_value` and `mask_value` to `max_tokens`, `oov_token` and `mask_token` to align with `StringLookup` and `TextVectorization`.\r\n        *   `TextVectorization` default for `pad_to_max_tokens` switched to False.\r\n        *   `CategoryEncoding` no longer supports `adapt`, `IntegerLookup` now supports equivalent functionality. `max_tokens` argument renamed to `num_tokens`.\r\n        *   `Discretization` added `num_bins` argument for learning bins  boundaries through calling `adapt` on a dataset. Renamed `bins` argument to `bin_boundaries` for specifying bins without `adapt`.\r\n    *   Improvements to model saving/loading:\r\n        *   `model.load_weights` now accepts paths to saved models.\r\n    *   Keras inputs can now be created directly from arbitrary `tf.TypeSpecs`.\r\n    *   Two new learning rate schedules added:`tf.keras.optimizers.schedules.CosineDecay` and `tf.keras.optimizers.schedules.CosineDecayRestarts`.\r\n\r\n*   `tf.data`:\r\n    *   Exposing `tf.data.experimental.ExternalStatePolicy`, which can be used to control how external state should be handled during dataset serialization or iterator checkpointing.\r\n    *   Changing `tf.data.experimental.save` to store the type specification of the dataset elements. This avoids the need for explicitly specifying the `element_spec` argument of `tf.data.experimental.load` when loading the previously saved dataset.\r\n    *   Add `.element_spec` property to `tf.data.DatasetSpec` to access the inner spec. This can be used to extract the structure of nested datasets.\r\n    *   Add `tf.data.experimental.AutoShardingPolicy.HINT` which can be used to provide hints to tf.distribute-based auto-sharding as to where in the input pipeline to insert sharding transformations.\r\n    *   Make tf.data.Options persistent across `tf.function` and `GraphDef` boundaries.\r\n        \r\n*   XLA compilation:\r\n    *   `tf.function(experimental_compile=True)` has become a stable API, renamed `tf.function(jit_compile=True)`.\r\n    *   XLA can now compile MirroredStrategy: the step function passed to `strategy.run` can now be annoted with `jit_compile=True`.\r\n\r\n*   `tf.distribute`:\r\n    *   Rename `experimental_prefetch_to_device` in `tf.distribute.InputOptions` to `experimental_fetch_to_device` to better reflect the purpose.\r\n\r\n*   `tf.lite`:\r\n    *   class `tflite::Subgraph`:\r\n        *   Removed the `tensors()` method and the non-const overload of the `nodes_and_registration()` method, both of which were previously documented as temporary and to be removed.\r\n            *   Uses of `tensors()` can be replaced by calling the existing methods `tensors_size()` and `tensor(int)`.\r\n            *   Uses of the non-const overload of `nodes_and_registration` can be replaced by calling the existing methods `nodes_size()` and `context()`, and then calling the `GetNodeAndRegistration` method in the `TfLiteContext` returned by `context()`.\r\n    *   NNAPI\r\n        *   Removed deprecated `Interpreter::UseNNAPI(bool)` C++ API.\r\n            *   Use `NnApiDelegate()` and related delegate configuration methods directly.\r\n        *  Replaced the model cache key for models computation algorithm with one guaranteed to be stable across runs.\r\n    *  16 bits quantization\r\n        *   Added int16x8 support for ABS, REDUCE_MAX and REDUCE_MIN operators.\r\n        *   Additional tests and fixes for ADD and SUB operators.\r\n    *  Added support for saved model's session initializer through `TFLiteConverter.from_saved_model`.\r\n    *  Added DEPTH_TO_SPACE support in Post training quantization.\r\n    *  Added dynamic range quantization support for the BatchMatMul op.\r\n        * Both symmetric and asymmetric quantized input tensor are supported.\r\n    *  Add `RFFT2D` as builtin op. (`RFFT2D` also supports `RFFTD`.) Currently only supports float32 input.\r\n    *  Add 5D support to `SLICE` op.\r\n    *  TFLite Supports SingatureDef:\r\n        * TFLiteConverter exports models with SignatureDef\r\n        * Interpreter supports getting a list of signatures and getting callable  function for a given signature def.\r\n    *  Add int8 support for `ReshapeV2`.\r\n    *  Add experimental support for optimization with sparsity.\r\n    *  Add nominal support for unsigned 32-bit integer tensor types. Note that very few TFLite kernels support this type natively, so its use in mobile ML authoring is generally discouraged.\r\n    *  Add support for static hash tables through `TFLiteConverter.from_saved_model`.\r\n    *  The Python TF Lite Interpreter bindings now has an option `experimental_preserve_all_tensors` to aid in debugging conversion.\r\n    *  Quantized x86 execution defaults to Ruy GEMM library for platforms with AVX support.\r\n    *  Deprecate `tf.compat.v1.lite.experimental.get_potentially_supported_ops`. Use `tf.lite.TFLiteConverter` directly to check whether a model is convertible.\r\n    * Add support to select one of three different built-in op resolvers to be\r\n    *  Enabled post training with calibrations for models that require user provided TensorFlow Lite custom op libraries via `converter.target_spec._experimental_custom_op_registerers`.\r\n      used in Python Interpreter API.\r\n*   TF Core:\r\n    *   Corrected higher-order gradients of control flow constructs (`tf.cond`, `tf.while_loop`, and compositions like `tf.foldl`) computed with `tf.GradientTape` inside a `tf.function`.\r\n    *   Changed the default step size in `gradient_checker_v2.compute_gradients` to be exactly representable as a binary floating point numbers. This avoids poluting gradient approximations needlessly, which is some cases leads to false negatives in op gradient tests.\r\n    * Added `tf.config.experimental.get_memory_info`, returning a dict with the current and peak memory usage. Deprecated `tf.config.experimental.get_memory_usage` in favor of this new function.\r\n    *   Extended `tf.config.experimental.enable_tensor_float_32_execution` to control Tensor-Float-32 evaluation in RNNs.\r\n    *   Added a 'experimental_payloads' field to tf.errors.OpError and  its subclasses to support more detailed error reporting. This is inspired from Abseil Status payloads: https://github.com/abseil/abseil-cpp/blob/master/absl/status/status.h\r\n\r\n*   `tf.summary`:\r\n    *   New `tf.summary.graph` allows manual write of TensorFlow graph (`tf.Graph` or `tf.compat.v1.GraphDef`) as a summary. This is not a replacement for the trace-based API.\r\n\r\n*   Set `/d2ReducedOptimizeHugeFunctions` by default for Windows builds. This provides a big compile-time speedup, and effectively raises the minimum supported MSVC version to 16.4 (current: 16.8).\r\n    *   See: https://groups.google.com/a/tensorflow.org/d/topic/build/SsW98Eo7l3o/discussion\r\n\r\n*   TensorRT\r\n    *   Removed the deprecated `session_config` parameter for the TF1-TRT converter `TrtGraphConverter`. Previously, we issued a warning when the value of the parameter is not None.\r\n    *   The TF2-TRT converter `TrtGraphConverterV2` takes an object of class TrtConversionParams as a parameter. Removed three deprecated fields from this class: `rewriter_config_template`, `is_dynamic_op`, and `max_batch_size`. Previously, we issued a warning when the value of `rewriter_config_template` is not None. We issued an error when the value of `is_dynamic_op` is not True. We didn't use the value for `max_batch_size` for building TensorRT engines. Add parameters `use_dynamic_shape` to enable dynamic shape support. The default is to disable dynamic shape support. Add `dynamic_shape_profile_strategy` for selecting a dynamic shape profile strategy. The default is profile strategy is `Range`.\r\n    *   Issue a warning when function get_tensorrt_rewriter_config is used.\r\n\r\n*   TF XLA\r\n    *   Add new enum value `MLIR_BRIDGE_ROLLOUT_SAFE_MODE_ENABLED` to `tf.config.experimental.mlir_bridge_rollout` to enable a \\\"safe\\\" mode. This runs the MLIR bridge only when an analysis of the graph only when an analysis of the graph determines that it is safe to run.\r\n    *   Add new enum value 'MLIR_BRIDGE_ROLLOUT_SAFE_MODE_FALLBACK_ENABLED' to `tf.config.experimental.mlir_bridge_rollout` to enable a fallback for the MLIR bridge in a \\\"safe\\\" mode. This runs the MLIR bridge in a FallbackEnabled mode when an analysis of the graph determines that the graph does not have unsupported features.\r\n*   Deterministic Op Functionality:\r\n    *   Add determinism-unimplemented exception-throwing to the segment-sum ops. When the environment variable `TF_DETERMINISTIC_OPS` is set to `\"true\"`  or `\"1\"` (when op-determinism is expected), an attempt to run the following ops on a GPU will throw `tf.errors.UnimplementedError` (with an understandable message) when `data` is a floating-point type, including complex types (if supported): `tf.math.segment_prod`, `tf.math.segment_sum`, `tf.math.unsorted_segment_mean`, `tf.math.unsorted_segment_sqrt_n`, `tf.math.unsorted_segment_prod`, `tf.math.unsorted_segment_sum`, and therefore also `tf.convert_to_tensor` when `value` is of type `tf.IndexedSlices` (such as in the backprop though `tf.gather` into a dense embedding). See issue [39751](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/39751) which this change addresses, but does not solve. This exception-throwing  behavior can be disabled by setting the environment variable `TF_DISABLE_SEGMENT_REDUCTION_OP_DETERMINISM_EXCEPTIONS` to `\"true\"` or `\"1\"`. For more information about these changes, see the description in pull request[47772](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/pull/47772).\r\n    *   In previous versions of TensorFlow, when a GPU was available,`tf.sparse.sparse_dense_matmul` introduced truly random noise in the forward path for data of type `tf.float32` but not for data of type `tf.float64` (for which there was no GPU implementation). In this current release, GPU support for other floating-point types (`tf.float16`, `tf.float64`, `tf.complex64`, and `tf.complex128`) has been added for this op. If you were relying on the determinism of the `tf.float64` CPU implementation being automatically selected because of the absence of the `tf.float64` GPU implementation, you with either need to force the op to run on the CPU or use a different data type.\r\n        \r\n* Other\r\n    *   Added `show_debug_info` to `mlir.convert_graph_def` and `mlir.convert_function`.\r\n    *   Added [Arm Compute Library (ACL)](https://github.com/ARM-software/ComputeLibrary) support to `--config=mkl_aarch64` build.\r\n\r\n## Thanks to our Contributors\r\n\r\nThis release contains contributions from many people at Google, as well as:\r\n\r\n8bitmp3, Aaron S.

With `num_parallel_calls` set, `deterministic` is used to indicate that outputs can be obtained in the non-deterministic order.\r\n    *   Options returned by `tf.data.Dataset.options()` are no longer mutable.\r\n    *   tf.data input pipelines can now be executed in debug mode, which disables any asynchrony, parallelism, or non-determinism and forces Python execution (as opposed to trace-compiled graph execution) of user-defined functions passed into transformations such as `map`. The debug mode can be enabled through `tf.data.experimental.enable_debug_mode()`.\r\n* `tf.lite`\r\n    *   Enabled the new MLIR-based quantization backend by default\r\n        *   The new backend is used for 8 bits full integer post-training quantization\r\n        *   The new backend removes the redundant rescales and fixes some bugs (shared weight/bias, extremely small scales, etc)\r\n        *   Set `experimental_new_quantizer` in tf.lite.TFLiteConverter to False to disable this change\r\n* `tf.keras`\r\n    *   Enabled a new supported input type in `Model.fit`, `tf.keras.utils.experimental.DatasetCreator`, which takes a callable, `dataset_fn`. `DatasetCreator` is intended to work across all `tf.distribute` strategies, and is the only input type supported for Parameter Server strategy.\r\n* `tf.distribute`\r\n    *   `tf.distribute.experimental.ParameterServerStrategy` now supports training with Keras `Model.fit` when used with `DatasetCreator`.\r\n* PluggableDevice\r\n    * Third-party devices can now connect to TensorFlow [modularly](https://github.com/tensorflow/community/blob/master/rfcs/20190305-modular-tensorflow.md) through [StreamExecutor C API](https://github.com/tensorflow/community/blob/master/rfcs/20200612-stream-executor-c-api.md). and [PluggableDevice](https://github.com/tensorflow/community/blob/master/rfcs/20200624-pluggable-device-for-tensorflow.md) interface.\r\n      * Add custom ops and kernels through [kernel and op registration C API](https://github.com/tensorflow/community/blob/master/rfcs/20190814-kernel-and-op-registration.md).\r\n      * Register custom graph optimization passes with [graph optimization C API](https://github.com/tensorflow/community/blob/master/rfcs/20201027-modular-tensorflow-graph-c-api.md).\r\n* [oneAPI Deep Neural Network Library (oneDNN)](https://github.com/oneapi-src/oneDNN) CPU performance optimizations from\r\n  [Intel-optimized TensorFlow](https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/articles/intel-optimization-for-tensorflow-installation-guide.html) are now available in the official x86-64 Linux and Windows builds.\r\n    * They are off by default. Enable them by setting the environment variable `TF_ENABLE_ONEDNN_OPTS=1`.\r\n    * We do not recommend using them in GPU systems, as they have not been sufficiently tested with GPUs yet.\r\n* TensorFlow pip packages are now built with CUDA11.2 and cuDNN 8.1.0      \r\n      \r\n## Breaking Changes\r\n\r\n* The `TF_CPP_MIN_VLOG_LEVEL` environment variable has been renamed to to\r\n  `TF_CPP_MAX_VLOG_LEVEL` which correctly describes its effect.\r\n\r\n## Bug Fixes and Other Changes\r\n\r\n*   `tf.keras`:\r\n    *   Preprocessing layers API consistency changes:\r\n        *   `StringLookup` added `output_mode`, `sparse`, and `pad_to_max_tokens` arguments with same semantics as `TextVectorization`.\r\n        *   `IntegerLookup` added `output_mode`, `sparse`, and `pad_to_max_tokens` arguments with same semantics as `TextVectorization`. Renamed `max_values`, `oov_value` and `mask_value` to `max_tokens`, `oov_token` and `mask_token` to align with `StringLookup` and `TextVectorization`.\r\n        *   `TextVectorization` default for `pad_to_max_tokens` switched to False.            \r\n        *   `CategoryEncoding` no longer supports `adapt`, `IntegerLookup`  now supports equivalent functionality. `max_tokens` argument renamed to `num_tokens`.           \r\n        *   `Discretization` added `num_bins` argument for learning bins boundaries through calling `adapt` on a dataset. Renamed `bins` argument to `bin_boundaries` for specifying bins without `adapt`.      \r\n    *   Improvements to model saving/loading:\r\n        *   `model.load_weights` now accepts paths to saved models.\r\n    *   Keras inputs can now be created directly from arbitrary `tf.TypeSpecs`.\r\n    *   Two new learning rate schedules added:\r\n        `tf.keras.optimizers.schedules.CosineDecay` and `tf.keras.optimizers.schedules.CosineDecayRestarts`.\r\n*   `tf.data`:\r\n    *   Exposing `tf.data.experimental.ExternalStatePolicy`, which can be used to control how external state should be handled during dataset serialization or iterator checkpointing.\r\n    *   Changing `tf.data.experimental.save` to store the type specification of the dataset elements. This avoids the need for explicitly specifying the `element_spec` argument of `tf.data.experimental.load` when loading the previously saved dataset.\r\n    *   Add `.element_spec` property to `tf.data.DatasetSpec` to access the  inner spec. This can be used to extract the structure of nested datasets.\r\n    *   Add `tf.data.experimental.AutoShardingPolicy.HINT` which can be used  to provide hints to tf.distribute-based auto-sharding as to where in  the input pipeline to insert sharding transformations.\r\n    *   Make tf.data.Options persistent across `tf.function` and `GraphDef` boundaries.\r\n        \r\n*   XLA compilation:\r\n    *   `tf.function(experimental_compile=True)` has become a stable API, renamed `tf.function(jit_compile=True)`.\r\n    *   XLA can now compile MirroredStrategy: the step function passed to `strategy.run` can now be annoted with `jit_compile=True`.\r\n\r\n*   `tf.distribute`:\r\n    *   Rename `experimental_prefetch_to_device` in `tf.distribute.InputOptions`  to `experimental_fetch_to_device` to better reflect the purpose.\r\n\r\n*   `tf.lite`:\r\n    *   class `tflite::Subgraph`:\r\n        *   Removed the `tensors()` method and the non-const overload of the `nodes_and_registration()` method, both of which were previously documented as temporary and to be removed.\r\n            *   Uses of `tensors()` can be replaced by calling the existing  methods `tensors_size()` and `tensor(int)`.\r\n            *   Uses of the non-const overload of `nodes_and_registration`  can be replaced by calling the existing methods `nodes_size()` and `context()`, and then calling the `GetNodeAndRegistration`  method in the `TfLiteContext` returned by `context()`.\r\n    *   NNAPI\r\n        *   Removed deprecated `Interpreter::UseNNAPI(bool)` C++ API.\r\n            *   Use `NnApiDelegate()` and related delegate configuration methods directly.\r\n        *  Replaced the model cache key for models computation algorithm with one guaranteed to be stable across runs.\r\n    *  16 bits quantization\r\n        *   Added int16x8 support for ABS, REDUCE_MAX and REDUCE_MIN operators.\r\n        *   Additional tests and fixes for ADD and SUB operators.\r\n    *  Added support for saved model's session initializer through `TFLiteConverter.from_saved_model`.\r\n    *  Added DEPTH_TO_SPACE support in Post training quantization.\r\n    *  Added dynamic range quantization support for the BatchMatMul op.\r\n        * Both symmetric and asymmetric quantized input tensor are supported.\r\n    *  Add `RFFT2D` as builtin op. (`RFFT2D` also supports `RFFTD`.) Currently only supports float32 input.\r\n    *  Add 5D support to `SLICE` op.\r\n    *  TFLite Supports SingatureDef:\r\n        * TFLiteConverter exports models with SignatureDef\r\n        * Interpreter supports getting a list of signatures and getting callable  function for a given signaturedef.\r\n    *  Add int8 support for `ReshapeV2`.\r\n    *  Add experimental support for optimization with sparsity.\r\n    *  Add nominal support for unsigned 32-bit integer tensor types. Note that  very few TFLite kernels support this type natively, so its use in mobile  ML authoring is generally discouraged.\r\n    *  Add support for static hash tables through `TFLiteConverter.from_saved_model`.\r\n    *  The Python TF Lite Interpreter bindings now has an option `experimental_preserve_all_tensors` to aid in debugging conversion.\r\n    *  Quantized x86 execution defaults to Ruy GEMM library for platforms with\r\n       AVX support.\r\n    *  Deprecate `tf.compat.v1.lite.experimental.get_potentially_supported_ops`. Use `tf.lite.TFLiteConverter` directly to check whether a model is convertible.\r\n    * Add support to select one of three different built-in op resolvers to be\r\n    *  Enabled post training with calibrations for models that require user provied TensorFlow Lite custom op libraries via `converter.target_spec._experimental_custom_op_registerers`.  used in Python Interpreter API.\r\n*   TF Core:\r\n    *   Corrected higher-order gradients of control flow constructs (`tf.cond`, `tf.while_loop`, and compositions like `tf.foldl`) computed with `tf.GradientTape` inside a `tf.function`.\r\n    *   Changed the default step size in `gradient_checker_v2.compute_gradients` to be exactly representable as a binary floating point numbers. This avoids poluting gradient approximations needlessly, which is some cases leads to false negatives in op gradient tests.\r\n    * Added `tf.config.experimental.get_memory_info`, returning a dict with the current and peak memory usage. Deprecated `tf.config.experimental.get_memory_usage` in favor of this new function.\r\n    *   Extended `tf.config.experimental.enable_tensor_float_32_execution` to control Tensor-Float-32 evaluation in RNNs.\r\n    *   Added a 'experimental_payloads' field to tf.errors.OpError and  its subclasses to support more detailed error reporting.This is inspired from Abseil Status payloads: https://github.com/abseil/abseil-cpp/blob/master/absl/status/status.h\r\n\r\n*   `tf.summary`:\r\n    *   New `tf.summary.graph` allows manual write of TensorFlow graph (`tf.Graph` or `tf.compat.v1.GraphDef`) as a summary. This is not a  replacement for the trace-based API.\r\n\r\n*   Set `/d2ReducedOptimizeHugeFunctions` by default for Windows builds. This provides a big compile-time speedup, and effectively raises the minimum supported MSVC version to 16.4 (current: 16.8).\r\n    *   See: https://groups.google.com/a/tensorflow.org/d/topic/build/SsW98Eo7l3o/discussion\r\n\r\n*   TensorRT\r\n    *   Removed the deprecated `session_config` parameter for the TF1-TRT converter `TrtGraphConverter`. Previously, we issued a warning when the value of the parameter is not None.\r\n    *   The TF2-TRT converter `TrtGraphConverterV2` takes an object of class TrtConversionParams as a parameter. Removed three deprecated fields from this class: `rewriter_config_template`, `is_dynamic_op`, and `max_batch_size`. Previously, we issued a warning when the value of `rewriter_config_template` is not None. We issued an error when the value of `is_dynamic_op` is not True. We didn't use the value for `max_batch_size` for building TensorRT engines. Add parameters `use_dynamic_shape` to enable dynamic shape support. The default is to disable dynamic shape support. Add `dynamic_shape_profile_strategy` for selecting a dynamic shape profile strategy. The default is profile strategy is `Range`.\r\n    *   Issue a warning when function get_tensorrt_rewriter_config is used.\r\n\r\n*   TF XLA\r\n    *   Add new enum value `MLIR_BRIDGE_ROLLOUT_SAFE_MODE_ENABLED` to `tf.config.experimental.mlir_bridge_rollout` to enable a \\\"safe\\\" mode. This runs the MLIR bridge only when an analysis of the graph only when an analysis of the graph determines that it is safe to run.\r\n    *   Add new enum value 'MLIR_BRIDGE_ROLLOUT_SAFE_MODE_FALLBACK_ENABLED' to `tf.config.experimental.mlir_bridge_rollout` to enable a fallback for the MLIR bridge in a \\\"safe\\\" mode. This runs the MLIR bridge in a FallbackEnabled mode when an analysis of the graph determines that the graph does not have unsupported features.\r\n*   Deterministic Op Functionality:\r\n    *   Add determinism-unimplemented exception-throwing to the segment-sum ops. When the environment variable `TF_DETERMINISTIC_OPS` is set to `\"true\"` or `\"1\"` (when op-determinism is expected), an attempt to run the following ops on a GPU will throw `tf.errors.UnimplementedError` (with an understandable message) when `data` is a floating-point type, including complex types (if supported): `tf.math.segment_prod`, `tf.math.segment_sum`, `tf.math.unsorted_segment_mean`, `tf.math.unsorted_segment_sqrt_n`, `tf.math.unsorted_segment_prod`, `tf.math.unsorted_segment_sum`, and therefore also `tf.convert_to_tensor` when `value` is of type `tf.IndexedSlices` (such  as in the backprop though `tf.gather` into a dense embedding). See issue [39751](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/39751)  which this change addresses, but does not solve. This exception-throwing  behavior can be disabled by setting the environment variable `TF_DISABLE_SEGMENT_REDUCTION_OP_DETERMINISM_EXCEPTIONS` to `\"true\"` or  `\"1\"`. For more information about these changes, see the description in  pull request [47772](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/pull/47772).\r\n    *   In previous versions of TensorFlow, when a GPU was available, `tf.sparse.sparse_dense_matmul` introduced truly random noise in the forward path for data of type `tf.float32` but not for data of type `tf.float64` (for which there was no GPU implementation). In this current release, GPU support for other floating-point types (`tf.float16`, `tf.float64`, `tf.complex64`, and `tf.complex128`) has been added for this op. If you were relying on the determinism of the `tf.float64` CPU implementation being automatically selected because of the absence of the `tf.float64` GPU implementation, you with either need to force the op to run on the CPU or use a different data type.\r\n        \r\n* Other\r\n    *   Added `show_debug_info` to `mlir.convert_graph_def` and `mlir.convert_function`.\r\n    *   Added [Arm Compute Library (ACL)](https://github.com/ARM-software/ComputeLibrary) support to `--config=mkl_aarch64` build.\r\n\r\n## Thanks to our Contributors\r\n\r\nThis release contains contributions from many people at Google, as well as:\r\n\r\n8bitmp3, Aaron S.

    "body": "# Release 2.5.0\r\n\r\n## Major Features and Improvements\r\n\r\n* Support for Python3.9 has been added.\r\n* TPU embedding support\r\n  * Added `profile_data_directory` to `EmbeddingConfigSpec` in\r\n    `_tpu_estimator_embedding.py`. This allows embedding lookup statistics\r\n    gathered at runtime to be used in embedding layer partitioning decisions.\r\n* `tf.keras.metrics.AUC` now support logit predictions.\r\n* Creating `tf.random.Generator` under `tf.distribute.Strategy` scopes is now allowed (except for `tf.distribute.experimental.CentralStorageStrategy` and `tf.distribute.experimental.ParameterServerStrategy`). Different replicas will get different random-number streams.\r\n* `tf.data`:\r\n    *   tf.data service now supports strict round-robin reads, which is useful\r\n        for synchronous training workloads where example sizes vary. With strict\r\n        round robin reads, users can guarantee that consumers get similar-sized\r\n        examples in the same step.\r\n    *   tf.data service now supports optional compression. Previously data would\r\n        always be compressed, but now you can disable compression by passing\r\n        `compression=None` to `tf.data.experimental.service.distribute(...)`.\r\n    *   `tf.data.Dataset.batch()` now supports `num_parallel_calls` and\r\n        `deterministic` arguments. `num_parallel_calls` is used to indicate that\r\n        multiple input batches should be computed in parallel. With\r\n        `num_parallel_calls` set, `deterministic` is used to indicate that\r\n        outputs can be obtained in the non-deterministic order.\r\n    *   Options returned by `tf.data.Dataset.options()` are no longer mutable.\r\n    *   tf.data input pipelines can now be executed in debug mode, which\r\n        disables any asynchrony, parallelism, or non-determinism and forces\r\n        Python execution (as opposed to trace-compiled graph execution) of\r\n        user-defined functions passed into transformations such as `map`. The\r\n        debug mode can be enabled through `tf.data.experimental.enable_debug_mode()`.\r\n* `tf.lite`\r\n    *   Enabled the new MLIR-based quantization backend by default\r\n        *   The new backend is used for 8 bits full integer post-training quantization\r\n        *   The new backend removes the redundant rescales and fixes some bugs (shared weight/bias, extremely small scales, etc)\r\n        *   Set `experimental_new_quantizer` in tf.lite.TFLiteConverter to False to disable this change\r\n* `tf.keras`\r\n    *   Enabled a new supported input type in `Model.fit`,\r\n        `tf.keras.utils.experimental.DatasetCreator`, which takes a\r\n        callable, `dataset_fn`.\r\n        `DatasetCreator` is intended to work across all `tf.distribute`\r\n        strategies, and is the only input type supported for Parameter Server\r\n        strategy.\r\n* `tf.distribute`\r\n    *   `tf.distribute.experimental.ParameterServerStrategy` now supports\r\n        training with Keras `Model.fit` when used with `DatasetCreator`.\r\n* PluggableDevice\r\n    * Third-party devices can now connect to TensorFlow [modularly](https://github.com/tensorflow/community/blob/master/rfcs/20190305-modular-tensorflow.md) through [StreamExecutor C API](https://github.com/tensorflow/community/blob/master/rfcs/20200612-stream-executor-c-api.md) and [PluggableDevice](https://github.com/tensorflow/community/blob/master/rfcs/20200624-pluggable-device-for-tensorflow.md) interface.\r\n      * Add custom ops and kernels through\r\n        [kernel and op registration C API](https://github.com/tensorflow/community/blob/master/rfcs/20190814-kernel-and-op-registration.md).\r\n      * Register custom graph optimization passes with\r\n        [graph optimization C API](https://github.com/tensorflow/community/blob/master/rfcs/20201027-modular-tensorflow-graph-c-api.md).\r\n* [oneAPI Deep Neural Network Library (oneDNN)](https://github.com/oneapi-src/oneDNN)\r\n  CPU performance optimizations from\r\n  [Intel-optimized TensorFlow](https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/articles/intel-optimization-for-tensorflow-installation-guide.html)\r\n  are now available in the official x86-64 Linux and Windows builds.\r\n    * They are off by default. Enable them by setting the environment variable\r\n      `TF_ENABLE_ONEDNN_OPTS=1`.\r\n    * We do not recommend using them in GPU systems, as they have not been\r\n      sufficiently tested with GPUs yet.\r\n\r\n* TensorFlow pip packages are now built with CUDA11.2 and cuDNN 8.1.0\r\n      \r\n## Breaking Changes\r\n\r\n* The `TF_CPP_MIN_VLOG_LEVEL` environment variable has been renamed to to\r\n  `TF_CPP_MAX_VLOG_LEVEL` which correctly describes its effect.\r\n\r\n## Bug Fixes and Other Changes\r\n\r\n*   `tf.keras`:\r\n    *   Preprocessing layers API consistency changes:\r\n        *   `StringLookup` added `output_mode`, `sparse`, and\r\n            `pad_to_max_tokens` arguments with same semantics as\r\n            `TextVectorization`.\r\n        *   `IntegerLookup` added `output_mode`, `sparse`, and\r\n            `pad_to_max_tokens` arguments with same semantics as\r\n            `TextVectorization`. Renamed `max_values`, `oov_value` and\r\n            `mask_value` to `max_tokens`, `oov_token` and `mask_token` to align\r\n            with `StringLookup` and `TextVectorization`.\r\n        *   `TextVectorization` default for `pad_to_max_tokens` switched to\r\n            False.\r\n        *   `CategoryEncoding` no longer supports `adapt`, `IntegerLookup`\r\n            now supports equivalent functionality. `max_tokens` argument renamed\r\n            to `num_tokens`.\r\n        *   `Discretization` added `num_bins` argument for learning bins\r\n            boundaries through calling `adapt` on a dataset. Renamed `bins`\r\n            argument to `bin_boundaries` for specifying bins without `adapt`.\r\n    *   Improvements to model saving/loading:\r\n        *   `model.load_weights` now accepts paths to saved models.\r\n    *   Keras inputs can now be created directly from arbitrary `tf.TypeSpecs`.\r\n    *   Two new learning rate schedules added:\r\n        `tf.keras.optimizers.schedules.CosineDecay` and\r\n        `tf.keras.optimizers.schedules.CosineDecayRestarts`.\r\n\r\n*   `tf.data`:\r\n    *   Exposing `tf.data.experimental.ExternalStatePolicy`, which can be used\r\n        to control how external state should be handled during dataset\r\n        serialization or iterator checkpointing.\r\n    *   Changing `tf.data.experimental.save` to store the type specification of\r\n        the dataset elements. This avoids the need for explicitly specifying the\r\n        `element_spec` argument of `tf.data.experimental.load` when loading the\r\n        previously saved dataset.\r\n    *   Add `.element_spec` property to `tf.data.DatasetSpec` to access the\r\n        inner spec. This can be used to extract the structure of nested\r\n        datasets.\r\n    *   Add `tf.data.experimental.AutoShardingPolicy.HINT` which can be used\r\n        to provide hints to tf.distribute-based auto-sharding as to where in\r\n        the input pipeline to insert sharding transformations.\r\n    *   Make tf.data.Options persistent across `tf.function` and `GraphDef`\r\n        boundaries.\r\n        \r\n*   XLA compilation:\r\n    *   `tf.function(experimental_compile=True)` has become a stable API,\r\n        renamed `tf.function(jit_compile=True)`.\r\n    *   XLA can now compile MirroredStrategy: the step function passed to\r\n        `strategy.run` can now be annoted with `jit_compile=True`.\r\n\r\n*   `tf.distribute`:\r\n    *   Rename `experimental_prefetch_to_device` in `tf.distribute.InputOptions`\r\n        to `experimental_fetch_to_device` to better reflect the purpose.\r\n\r\n*   `tf.lite`:\r\n    *   class `tflite::Subgraph`:\r\n        *   Removed the `tensors()` method and the non-const overload of the\r\n            `nodes_and_registration()` method, both of which were previously\r\n            documented as temporary and to be removed.\r\n            *   Uses of `tensors()` can be replaced by calling the existing\r\n                methods `tensors_size()` and `tensor(int)`.\r\n            *   Uses of the non-const overload of `nodes_and_registration`\r\n                can be replaced by calling the existing methods `nodes_size()`\r\n                and `context()`, and then calling the `GetNodeAndRegistration`\r\n                method in the `TfLiteContext` returned by `context()`.\r\n    *   NNAPI\r\n        *   Removed deprecated `Interpreter::UseNNAPI(bool)` C++ API.\r\n            *   Use `NnApiDelegate()` and related delegate configuration methods\r\n                directly.\r\n        *  Replaced the model cache key for models computation algorithm with\r\n           one guaranteed to be stable across runs.\r\n    *  16 bits quantization\r\n        *   Added int16x8 support for ABS, REDUCE_MAX and REDUCE_MIN operators.\r\n        *   Additional tests and fixes for ADD and SUB operators.\r\n    *  Added support for saved model's session initializer through\r\n         `TFLiteConverter.from_saved_model`.\r\n    *  Added DEPTH_TO_SPACE support in Post training quantization.\r\n    *  Added dynamic range quantization support for the BatchMatMul op.\r\n        * Both symmetric and asymmetric quantized input tensor are supported.\r\n    *  Add `RFFT2D` as builtin op. (`RFFT2D` also supports `RFFTD`.) Currently\r\n       only supports float32 input.\r\n    *  Add 5D support to `SLICE` op.\r\n    *  TFLite Supports SingatureDef:\r\n        * TFLiteConverter exports models with SignatureDef\r\n        * Interpreter supports getting a list of signatures and getting callable\r\n          function for a given signaturedef.\r\n    *  Add int8 support for `ReshapeV2`.\r\n    *  Add experimental support for optimization with sparsity.\r\n    *  Add nominal support for unsigned 32-bit integer tensor types. Note that\r\n       very few TFLite kernels support this type natively, so its use in mobile\r\n       ML authoring is generally discouraged.\r\n    *  Add support for static hash tables through\r\n         `TFLiteConverter.from_saved_model`.\r\n    *  The Python TF Lite Interpreter bindings now has an option\r\n        `experimental_preserve_all_tensors` to aid in debugging conversion.\r\n    *  Quantized x86 execution defaults to Ruy GEMM library for platforms with\r\n       AVX support.\r\n    *  Deprecate `tf.compat.v1.lite.experimental.get_potentially_supported_ops`.\r\n       Use `tf.lite.TFLiteConverter` directly to check whether a model is\r\n       convertible.\r\n    * Add support to select one of three different built-in op resolvers to be\r\n    *  Enabled post training with calibrations for models that require user\r\n       provied TensorFlow Lite custom op libraries via\r\n       `converter.target_spec._experimental_custom_op_registerers`.\r\n      used in Python Interpreter API.\r\n*   TF Core:\r\n    *   Corrected higher-order gradients of control flow constructs (`tf.cond`,\r\n        `tf.while_loop`, and compositions like `tf.foldl`) computed with\r\n        `tf.GradientTape` inside a `tf.function`.\r\n    *   Changed the default step size in `gradient_checker_v2.compute_gradients` to be exactly representable as a binary floating point numbers. This avoids poluting gradient approximations needlessly, which is some cases leads to false negatives in op gradient tests.\r\n    * Added `tf.config.experimental.get_memory_info`, returning a dict with the\r\n      current and peak memory usage. Deprecated\r\n      `tf.config.experimental.get_memory_usage` in favor of this new function.\r\n    *   Extended `tf.config.experimental.enable_tensor_float_32_execution` to\r\n        control Tensor-Float-32 evaluation in RNNs.\r\n    *   Added a 'experimental_payloads' field to tf.errors.OpError and\r\n        its subclasses to support more detailed error reporting.\r\n        This is inspired from Abseil Status payloads:\r\n        https://github.com/abseil/abseil-cpp/blob/master/absl/status/status.h\r\n\r\n*   `tf.summary`:\r\n    *   New `tf.summary.graph` allows manual write of TensorFlow graph\r\n        (`tf.Graph` or `tf.compat.v1.GraphDef`) as a summary. This is not a\r\n        replacement for the trace-based API.\r\n\r\n*   Set `/d2ReducedOptimizeHugeFunctions` by default for Windows builds. This\r\n    provides a big compile-time speedup, and effectively raises the minimum\r\n    supported MSVC version to 16.4 (current: 16.8).\r\n    *   See: https://groups.google.com/a/tensorflow.org/d/topic/build/SsW98Eo7l3o/discussion\r\n\r\n*   TensorRT\r\n    *   Removed the deprecated `session_config` parameter for the TF1-TRT\r\n        converter `TrtGraphConverter`. Previously, we issued a warning when the\r\n        value of the parameter is not None.\r\n    *   The TF2-TRT converter `TrtGraphConverterV2` takes an object of class\r\n        TrtConversionParams as a parameter. Removed three deprecated fields from\r\n        this class: `rewriter_config_template`, `is_dynamic_op`, and\r\n        `max_batch_size`. Previously, we issued a warning when the value of\r\n        `rewriter_config_template` is not None. We issued an error when the\r\n        value of `is_dynamic_op` is not True. We didn't use the value for\r\n        `max_batch_size` for building TensorRT engines. Add parameters\r\n         `use_dynamic_shape` to enable dynamic shape support. The default is to\r\n         disable dynamic shape support. Add `dynamic_shape_profile_strategy`\r\n         for selecting a dynamic shape profile strategy. The default is profile\r\n         strategy is `Range`.\r\n    *   Issue a warning when function get_tensorrt_rewriter_config is used.\r\n\r\n*   TF XLA\r\n    *   Add new enum value `MLIR_BRIDGE_ROLLOUT_SAFE_MODE_ENABLED` to\r\n        `tf.config.experimental.mlir_bridge_rollout` to enable a \\\"safe\\\" mode.\r\n        This runs the MLIR bridge only when an analysis of the graph only when\r\n        an analysis of the graph determines that it is safe to run.\r\n    *   Add new enum value 'MLIR_BRIDGE_ROLLOUT_SAFE_MODE_FALLBACK_ENABLED' to\r\n        `tf.config.experimental.mlir_bridge_rollout` to enable a fallback for\r\n        the MLIR bridge in a \\\"safe\\\" mode. This runs the MLIR bridge in a\r\n        FallbackEnabled mode when an analysis of the graph determines\r\n        that the graph does not have unsupported features.\r\n\r\n* Other\r\n    *   Added `show_debug_info` to `mlir.convert_graph_def` and\r\n        `mlir.convert_function`.\r\n    *   Added [Arm Compute Library (ACL)](https://github.com/ARM-software/ComputeLibrary)\r\n        support to `--config=mkl_aarch64` build.\r\n\r\n## Thanks to our Contributors\r\n\r\nThis release contains contributions from many people at Google, as well as:\r\n\r\n8bitmp3, Aaron S.

    "body": "# Release 2.5.0\r\n\r\n## Major Features and Improvements\r\n\r\n* TPU embedding support\r\n  * Added `profile_data_directory` to `EmbeddingConfigSpec` in\r\n    `_tpu_estimator_embedding.py`. This allows embedding lookup statistics\r\n    gathered at runtime to be used in embedding layer partitioning decisions.\r\n* `tf.keras.metrics.AUC` now support logit predictions.\r\n* Creating `tf.random.Generator` under `tf.distribute.Strategy` scopes is now allowed (except for `tf.distribute.experimental.CentralStorageStrategy` and `tf.distribute.experimental.ParameterServerStrategy`). Different replicas will get different random-number streams.\r\n* `tf.data`:\r\n    *   tf.data service now supports strict round-robin reads, which is useful\r\n        for synchronous training workloads where example sizes vary. With strict\r\n        round robin reads, users can guarantee that consumers get similar-sized\r\n        examples in the same step.\r\n    *   tf.data service now supports optional compression. Previously data would\r\n        always be compressed, but now you can disable compression by passing\r\n        `compression=None` to `tf.data.experimental.service.distribute(...)`.\r\n    *   `tf.data.Dataset.batch()` now supports `num_parallel_calls` and\r\n        `deterministic` arguments. `num_parallel_calls` is used to indicate that\r\n        multiple input batches should be computed in parallel. With\r\n        `num_parallel_calls` set, `deterministic` is used to indicate that\r\n        outputs can be obtained in the non-deterministic order.\r\n    *   Options returned by `tf.data.Dataset.options()` are no longer mutable.\r\n    *   tf.data input pipelines can now be executed in debug mode, which\r\n        disables any asynchrony, parallelism, or non-determinism and forces\r\n        Python execution (as opposed to trace-compiled graph execution) of\r\n        user-defined functions passed into transformations such as `map`. The\r\n        debug mode can be enabled through `tf.data.experimental.enable_debug_mode()`.\r\n* `tf.lite`\r\n    *   Enabled the new MLIR-based quantization backend by default\r\n        *   The new backend is used for 8 bits full integer post-training quantization\r\n        *   The new backend removes the redundant rescales and fixes some bugs (shared weight/bias, extremely small scales, etc)\r\n        *   Set `experimental_new_quantizer` in tf.lite.TFLiteConverter to False to disable this change\r\n* `tf.keras`\r\n    *   Enabled a new supported input type in `Model.fit`,\r\n        `tf.keras.utils.experimental.DatasetCreator`, which takes a\r\n        callable, `dataset_fn`.\r\n        `DatasetCreator` is intended to work across all `tf.distribute`\r\n        strategies, and is the only input type supported for Parameter Server\r\n        strategy.\r\n* `tf.distribute`\r\n    *   `tf.distribute.experimental.ParameterServerStrategy` now supports\r\n        training with Keras `Model.fit` when used with `DatasetCreator`.\r\n* PluggableDevice\r\n    * Third-party devices can now connect to TensorFlow [modularly](https://github.com/tensorflow/community/blob/master/rfcs/20190305-modular-tensorflow.md) through [StreamExecutor C API](https://github.com/tensorflow/community/blob/master/rfcs/20200612-stream-executor-c-api.md) and [PluggableDevice](https://github.com/tensorflow/community/blob/master/rfcs/20200624-pluggable-device-for-tensorflow.md) interface.\r\n      * Add custom ops and kernels through\r\n        [kernel and op registration C API](https://github.com/tensorflow/community/blob/master/rfcs/20190814-kernel-and-op-registration.md).\r\n      * Register custom graph optimization passes with\r\n        [graph optimization C API](https://github.com/tensorflow/community/blob/master/rfcs/20201027-modular-tensorflow-graph-c-api.md).\r\n* [oneAPI Deep Neural Network Library (oneDNN)](https://github.com/oneapi-src/oneDNN)\r\n  CPU performance optimizations from\r\n  [Intel-optimized TensorFlow](https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/articles/intel-optimization-for-tensorflow-installation-guide.html)\r\n  are now available in the official x86-64 Linux and Windows builds.\r\n    * They are off by default. Enable them by setting the environment variable\r\n      `TF_ENABLE_ONEDNN_OPTS=1`.\r\n    * We do not recommend using them in GPU systems, as they have not been\r\n      sufficiently tested with GPUs yet.\r\n\r\n* TensorFlow pip packages are now built with CUDA11.2 and cuDNN 8.1.0\r\n      \r\n## Breaking Changes\r\n\r\n* The `TF_CPP_MIN_VLOG_LEVEL` environment variable has been renamed to to\r\n  `TF_CPP_MAX_VLOG_LEVEL` which correctly describes its effect.\r\n\r\n## Bug Fixes and Other Changes\r\n\r\n*   `tf.keras`:\r\n    *   Preprocessing layers API consistency changes:\r\n        *   `StringLookup` added `output_mode`, `sparse`, and\r\n            `pad_to_max_tokens` arguments with same semantics as\r\n            `TextVectorization`.\r\n        *   `IntegerLookup` added `output_mode`, `sparse`, and\r\n            `pad_to_max_tokens` arguments with same semantics as\r\n            `TextVectorization`. Renamed `max_values`, `oov_value` and\r\n            `mask_value` to `max_tokens`, `oov_token` and `mask_token` to align\r\n            with `StringLookup` and `TextVectorization`.\r\n        *   `TextVectorization` default for `pad_to_max_tokens` switched to\r\n            False.\r\n        *   `CategoryEncoding` no longer supports `adapt`, `IntegerLookup`\r\n            now supports equivalent functionality. `max_tokens` argument renamed\r\n            to `num_tokens`.\r\n        *   `Discretization` added `num_bins` argument for learning bins\r\n            boundaries through calling `adapt` on a dataset. Renamed `bins`\r\n            argument to `bin_boundaries` for specifying bins without `adapt`.\r\n    *   Improvements to model saving/loading:\r\n        *   `model.load_weights` now accepts paths to saved models.\r\n    *   Keras inputs can now be created directly from arbitrary `tf.TypeSpecs`.\r\n    *   Two new learning rate schedules added:\r\n        `tf.keras.optimizers.schedules.CosineDecay` and\r\n        `tf.keras.optimizers.schedules.CosineDecayRestarts`.\r\n\r\n*   `tf.data`:\r\n    *   Exposing `tf.data.experimental.ExternalStatePolicy`, which can be used\r\n        to control how external state should be handled during dataset\r\n        serialization or iterator checkpointing.\r\n    *   Changing `tf.data.experimental.save` to store the type specification of\r\n        the dataset elements. This avoids the need for explicitly specifying the\r\n        `element_spec` argument of `tf.data.experimental.load` when loading the\r\n        previously saved dataset.\r\n    *   Add `.element_spec` property to `tf.data.DatasetSpec` to access the\r\n        inner spec. This can be used to extract the structure of nested\r\n        datasets.\r\n    *   Add `tf.data.experimental.AutoShardingPolicy.HINT` which can be used\r\n        to provide hints to tf.distribute-based auto-sharding as to where in\r\n        the input pipeline to insert sharding transformations.\r\n    *   Make tf.data.Options persistent across `tf.function` and `GraphDef`\r\n        boundaries.\r\n        \r\n*   XLA compilation:\r\n    *   `tf.function(experimental_compile=True)` has become a stable API,\r\n        renamed `tf.function(jit_compile=True)`.\r\n    *   XLA can now compile MirroredStrategy: the step function passed to\r\n        `strategy.run` can now be annoted with `jit_compile=True`.\r\n\r\n*   `tf.distribute`:\r\n    *   Rename `experimental_prefetch_to_device` in `tf.distribute.InputOptions`\r\n        to `experimental_fetch_to_device` to better reflect the purpose.\r\n\r\n*   `tf.lite`:\r\n    *   class `tflite::Subgraph`:\r\n        *   Removed the `tensors()` method and the non-const overload of the\r\n            `nodes_and_registration()` method, both of which were previously\r\n            documented as temporary and to be removed.\r\n            *   Uses of `tensors()` can be replaced by calling the existing\r\n                methods `tensors_size()` and `tensor(int)`.\r\n            *   Uses of the non-const overload of `nodes_and_registration`\r\n                can be replaced by calling the existing methods `nodes_size()`\r\n                and `context()`, and then calling the `GetNodeAndRegistration`\r\n                method in the `TfLiteContext` returned by `context()`.\r\n    *   NNAPI\r\n        *   Removed deprecated `Interpreter::UseNNAPI(bool)` C++ API.\r\n            *   Use `NnApiDelegate()` and related delegate configuration methods\r\n                directly.\r\n        *  Replaced the model cache key for models computation algorithm with\r\n           one guaranteed to be stable across runs.\r\n    *  16 bits quantization\r\n        *   Added int16x8 support for ABS, REDUCE_MAX and REDUCE_MIN operators.\r\n        *   Additional tests and fixes for ADD and SUB operators.\r\n    *  Added support for saved model's session initializer through\r\n         `TFLiteConverter.from_saved_model`.\r\n    *  Added DEPTH_TO_SPACE support in Post training quantization.\r\n    *  Added dynamic range quantization support for the BatchMatMul op.\r\n        * Both symmetric and asymmetric quantized input tensor are supported.\r\n    *  Add `RFFT2D` as builtin op. (`RFFT2D` also supports `RFFTD`.) Currently\r\n       only supports float32 input.\r\n    *  Add 5D support to `SLICE` op.\r\n    *  TFLite Supports SingatureDef:\r\n        * TFLiteConverter exports models with SignatureDef\r\n        * Interpreter supports getting a list of signatures and getting callable\r\n          function for a given signaturedef.\r\n    *  Add int8 support for `ReshapeV2`.\r\n    *  Add experimental support for optimization with sparsity.\r\n    *  Add nominal support for unsigned 32-bit integer tensor types. Note that\r\n       very few TFLite kernels support this type natively, so its use in mobile\r\n       ML authoring is generally discouraged.\r\n    *  Add support for static hash tables through\r\n         `TFLiteConverter.from_saved_model`.\r\n    *  The Python TF Lite Interpreter bindings now has an option\r\n        `experimental_preserve_all_tensors` to aid in debugging conversion.\r\n    *  Quantized x86 execution defaults to Ruy GEMM library for platforms with\r\n       AVX support.\r\n    *  Deprecate `tf.compat.v1.lite.experimental.get_potentially_supported_ops`.\r\n       Use `tf.lite.TFLiteConverter` directly to check whether a model is\r\n       convertible.\r\n    * Add support to select one of three different built-in op resolvers to be\r\n    *  Enabled post training with calibrations for models that require user\r\n       provied TensorFlow Lite custom op libraries via\r\n       `converter.target_spec._experimental_custom_op_registerers`.\r\n      used in Python Interpreter API.\r\n*   TF Core:\r\n    *   Corrected higher-order gradients of control flow constructs (`tf.cond`,\r\n        `tf.while_loop`, and compositions like `tf.foldl`) computed with\r\n        `tf.GradientTape` inside a `tf.function`.\r\n    *   Changed the default step size in `gradient_checker_v2.compute_gradients` to be exactly representable as a binary floating point numbers. This avoids poluting gradient approximations needlessly, which is some cases leads to false negatives in op gradient tests.\r\n    * Added `tf.config.experimental.get_memory_info`, returning a dict with the\r\n      current and peak memory usage. Deprecated\r\n      `tf.config.experimental.get_memory_usage` in favor of this new function.\r\n    *   Extended `tf.config.experimental.enable_tensor_float_32_execution` to\r\n        control Tensor-Float-32 evaluation in RNNs.\r\n    *   Added a 'experimental_payloads' field to tf.errors.OpError and\r\n        its subclasses to support more detailed error reporting.\r\n        This is inspired from Abseil Status payloads:\r\n        https://github.com/abseil/abseil-cpp/blob/master/absl/status/status.h\r\n\r\n*   `tf.summary`:\r\n    *   New `tf.summary.graph` allows manual write of TensorFlow graph\r\n        (`tf.Graph` or `tf.compat.v1.GraphDef`) as a summary. This is not a\r\n        replacement for the trace-based API.\r\n\r\n*   Set `/d2ReducedOptimizeHugeFunctions` by default for Windows builds. This\r\n    provides a big compile-time speedup, and effectively raises the minimum\r\n    supported MSVC version to 16.4 (current: 16.8).\r\n    *   See: https://groups.google.com/a/tensorflow.org/d/topic/build/SsW98Eo7l3o/discussion\r\n\r\n*   TensorRT\r\n    *   Removed the deprecated `session_config` parameter for the TF1-TRT\r\n        converter `TrtGraphConverter`. Previously, we issued a warning when the\r\n        value of the parameter is not None.\r\n    *   The TF2-TRT converter `TrtGraphConverterV2` takes an object of class\r\n        TrtConversionParams as a parameter. Removed three deprecated fields from\r\n        this class: `rewriter_config_template`, `is_dynamic_op`, and\r\n        `max_batch_size`. Previously, we issued a warning when the value of\r\n        `rewriter_config_template` is not None. We issued an error when the\r\n        value of `is_dynamic_op` is not True. We didn't use the value for\r\n        `max_batch_size` for building TensorRT engines. Add parameters\r\n         `use_dynamic_shape` to enable dynamic shape support. The default is to\r\n         disable dynamic shape support. Add `dynamic_shape_profile_strategy`\r\n         for selecting a dynamic shape profile strategy. The default is profile\r\n         strategy is `Range`.\r\n    *   Issue a warning when function get_tensorrt_rewriter_config is used.\r\n\r\n*   TF XLA\r\n    *   Add new enum value `MLIR_BRIDGE_ROLLOUT_SAFE_MODE_ENABLED` to\r\n        `tf.config.experimental.mlir_bridge_rollout` to enable a \\\"safe\\\" mode.\r\n        This runs the MLIR bridge only when an analysis of the graph only when\r\n        an analysis of the graph determines that it is safe to run.\r\n    *   Add new enum value 'MLIR_BRIDGE_ROLLOUT_SAFE_MODE_FALLBACK_ENABLED' to\r\n        `tf.config.experimental.mlir_bridge_rollout` to enable a fallback for\r\n        the MLIR bridge in a \\\"safe\\\" mode. This runs the MLIR bridge in a\r\n        FallbackEnabled mode when an analysis of the graph determines\r\n        that the graph does not have unsupported features.\r\n\r\n* Other\r\n    *   Added `show_debug_info` to `mlir.convert_graph_def` and\r\n        `mlir.convert_function`.\r\n    *   Added [Arm Compute Library (ACL)](https://github.com/ARM-software/ComputeLibrary)\r\n        support to `--config=mkl_aarch64` build.\r\n\r\n## Thanks to our Contributors\r\n\r\nThis release contains contributions from many people at Google, as well as:\r\n\r\n8bitmp3, Aaron S.

    "body": "# Release 2.4.0\r\n\r\n## Major Features and Improvements\r\n\r\n* `tf.distribute` introduces experimental support for asynchronous training of models via the [`tf.distribute.experimental.ParameterServerStrategy`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/distribute/experimental/ParameterServerStrategy) API. Please see the [tutorial](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/distribute/parameter_server_training) to learn more.\r\n\r\n* [`MultiWorkerMirroredStrategy`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/distribute/MultiWorkerMirroredStrategy) is now a stable API and is no longer considered experimental. Some of the major improvements involve handling peer failure and many bug fixes. Please check out the detailed tutorial on [Multi-worker training with Keras](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/distribute/multi_worker_with_keras). \r\n\r\n* Introduces experimental support for a new module named [`tf.experimental.numpy`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/experimental/numpy) which is a NumPy-compatible API for writing TF programs. See the [detailed guide](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/tf_numpy) to learn more. Additional details below. \r\n\r\n* Adds Support for\r\n  [TensorFloat-32](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2020/05/14/tensorfloat-32-precision-format/) on Ampere based GPUs. TensorFloat-32, or TF32 for short, is a math mode for NVIDIA Ampere based GPUs and is enabled by default. \r\n  \r\n* A major refactoring of the internals of the Keras Functional API has been completed, that should improve the reliability, stability, and performance of constructing Functional models.\r\n\r\n* Keras mixed precision API [`tf.keras.mixed_precision`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/mixed_precision?version=nightly) is no longer experimental and allows the use of 16-bit floating point formats during training, improving performance by up to 3x on GPUs and 60% on TPUs. Please see below for additional details.\r\n\r\n* TensorFlow Profiler now supports profiling `MultiWorkerMirroredStrategy` and tracing multiple workers using the [sampling mode API](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/profiler#profiling_apis).\r\n\r\n* TFLite Profiler for Android is available. See the detailed [guide](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/performance/measurement#trace_tensorflow_lite_internals_in_android) to learn more.\r\n\r\n* TensorFlow pip packages are now built with CUDA11 and cuDNN 8.0.2.\r\n\r\n## Breaking Changes\r\n\r\n* TF Core:\r\n  * Certain float32 ops run in lower precsion on Ampere based GPUs, including  matmuls and convolutions, due to the use of [TensorFloat-32](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2020/05/14/tensorfloat-32-precision-format/). Specifically, inputs to such ops are rounded from 23 bits of precision to 10\r\n  bits of precision. This is unlikely to cause issues in practice for deep learning models. In some cases, TensorFloat-32 is also used for complex64 ops.\r\n  TensorFloat-32 can be disabled by running `tf.config.experimental.enable_tensor_float_32_execution(False)`. \r\n  * The byte layout for string tensors across the C-API has been updated to match TF Core/C++; i.e., a contiguous array of `tensorflow::tstring`/`TF_TString`s.\r\n  * C-API functions `TF_StringDecode`, `TF_StringEncode`, and `TF_StringEncodedSize` are no longer relevant and have been removed; see `core/platform/ctstring.h` for  string access/modification in C.\r\n  * `tensorflow.python`, `tensorflow.core` and `tensorflow.compiler` modules are now hidden. These modules are not part of TensorFlow public API.\r\n  * `tf.raw_ops.Max` and `tf.raw_ops.Min` no longer accept inputs of type `tf.complex64` or `tf.complex128`, because the behavior of these ops is not well defined for complex types.\r\n  * XLA:CPU and XLA:GPU devices are no longer registered by default. Use `TF_XLA_FLAGS=--tf_xla_enable_xla_devices` if you really need them, but this flag will eventually be removed in subsequent releases.\r\n\r\n* `tf.keras`:  \r\n  * The `steps_per_execution` argument in `model.compile()` is no longer experimental; if you were passing `experimental_steps_per_execution`, rename it to `steps_per_execution` in your code. This argument controls the number of batches to run during each `tf.function` call when calling `model.fit()`. Running multiple batches inside a single `tf.function` call can greatly improve performance on TPUs or small models with a large Python overhead.\r\n  * A **major refactoring** of the internals of the Keras Functional API may affect code that\r\n  is relying on certain internal details:\r\n    * Code that uses `isinstance(x, tf.Tensor)` instead of `tf.is_tensor` when checking Keras symbolic inputs/outputs should switch to using `tf.is_tensor`.\r\n    * Code that is overly dependent on the exact names attached to symbolic tensors (e.g. assumes there will be \":0\" at the end of the inputs, treats names as unique identifiers instead of using `tensor.ref()`, etc.) may break. \r\n    * Code that uses full path for `get_concrete_function` to trace Keras symbolic inputs directly should switch to building matching `tf.TensorSpec`s directly and tracing the `TensorSpec` objects.\r\n    * Code that relies on the exact number and names of the op layers that TensorFlow operations  were converted into may have changed.\r\n    * Code that uses `tf.map_fn`/`tf.cond`/`tf.while_loop`/control flow as op layers and  happens to work before TF 2.4. These will explicitly be unsupported now. Converting these ops to Functional API op layers was unreliable before TF 2.4, and prone to erroring incomprehensibly  or being silently buggy.\r\n    * Code that directly asserts on a Keras symbolic value in cases where ops like `tf.rank` used to  return a static or symbolic value depending on if the input had a fully static shape or not. Now these ops always return symbolic values.\r\n    * Code already susceptible to leaking tensors outside of graphs becomes slightly more likely to do so now.\r\n    * Code that tries directly getting gradients with respect to symbolic Keras inputs/outputs. Use `GradientTape` on the actual Tensors passed to the already-constructed model instead.\r\n    * Code that requires very tricky shape manipulation via converted op layers in order to work, where the Keras symbolic shape inference proves insufficient.\r\n    * Code that tries manually walking a `tf.keras.Model` layer by layer and assumes layers only ever have one positional argument. This assumption doesn't hold       true before TF 2.4 either, but is more likely to cause issues now.\r\n    * Code that manually enters `keras.backend.get_graph()` before building a functional model is no longer needed.\r\n    * Start enforcing input shape assumptions when calling Functional API Keras models. This may potentially break some users, in case there is a mismatch             between the shape used when creating `Input` objects in a Functional model, and the shape of the data passed to that model. You can fix this mismatch by         either calling the model with correctly-shaped data, or by relaxing `Input` shape assumptions (note that you can pass shapes with `None` entries for axes\r\n      that are meant to be dynamic). You can also disable the input checking entirely by setting `model.input_spec = None`.\r\n  * Several changes have been made to `tf.keras.mixed_precision.experimental`. Note that it is now recommended to use the non-experimental          `tf.keras.mixed_precision` API.\r\n   * `AutoCastVariable.dtype` now refers to the actual variable dtype, not the dtype it will be casted to.\r\n   * When mixed precision is enabled, `tf.keras.layers.Embedding` now outputs a float16 or bfloat16 tensor instead of a float32 tensor.\r\n   * The property `tf.keras.mixed_precision.experimental.LossScaleOptimizer.loss_scale` is now a tensor, not a `LossScale` object. This means to get a loss scale      of a `LossScaleOptimizer` as a tensor, you must now call `opt.loss_scale`instead of `opt.loss_scale()`.\r\n   * The property `should_cast_variables` has been removed from `tf.keras.mixed_precision.experimental.Policy`\r\n   * When passing a `tf.mixed_precision.experimental.DynamicLossScale` to `tf.keras.mixed_precision.experimental.LossScaleOptimizer`, the `DynamicLossScale`'s        multiplier must be 2.\r\n   * When passing a `tf.mixed_precision.experimental.DynamicLossScale` to `tf.keras.mixed_precision.experimental.LossScaleOptimizer`, the weights of\r\n     the `DynanmicLossScale` are copied into the `LossScaleOptimizer` instead of being reused. This means modifying the weights of the `DynamicLossScale` will no      longer affect the weights of the LossScaleOptimizer, and vice versa.\r\n   * The global policy can no longer be set to a non-floating point policy in `tf.keras.mixed_precision.experimental.set_policy`\r\n   * In `Layer.call`, `AutoCastVariable`s will no longer be casted within `MirroredStrategy.run` or `ReplicaContext.merge_call`. This is because a thread local        variable is used to determine whether `AutoCastVariable`s are casted, and those two functions run with a different thread. Note this only applies if one of      these two functions is called within `Layer.call`; if one of those two functions calls `Layer.call`, `AutoCastVariable`s will still be casted.\r\n\r\n* `tf.data`:\r\n  * `tf.data.experimental.service.DispatchServer` now takes a config tuple instead of individual arguments. Usages should be updated to      `tf.data.experimental.service.DispatchServer(dispatcher_config)`.\r\n  * `tf.data.experimental.service.WorkerServer` now takes a config tuple instead of individual arguments. Usages should be updated to  `tf.data.experimental.service.WorkerServer(worker_config)`.\r\n  \r\n* `tf.distribute`:\r\n  * Removes `tf.distribute.Strategy.experimental_make_numpy_dataset`. Please use `tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices` instead.\r\n  * Renames `experimental_hints` in `tf.distribute.StrategyExtended.reduce_to`, `tf.distribute.StrategyExtended.batch_reduce_to`,      `tf.distribute.ReplicaContext.all_reduce` to `options`.\r\n  * Renames `tf.distribute.experimental.CollectiveHints` to `tf.distribute.experimental.CommunicationOptions`.\r\n  * Renames `tf.distribute.experimental.CollectiveCommunication` to `tf.distribute.experimental.CommunicationImplementation`.\r\n  * Renames `tf.distribute.Strategy.experimental_distribute_datasets_from_function` to `distribute_datasets_from_function` as it is no longer experimental. \r\n  * Removes `tf.distribute.Strategy.experimental_run_v2` method, which was deprecated in TF 2.2.\r\n\r\n* `tf.lite`:\r\n  * `tf.quantization.quantize_and_dequantize_v2` has been introduced, which updates the gradient definition for quantization which is outside the range\r\n     to be 0. To simulate the V1 the behavior of `tf.quantization.quantize_and_dequantize(...)` use             `tf.grad_pass_through(tf.quantization.quantize_and_dequantize_v2)(...)`.\r\n\r\n* Building TensorFlow:\r\n  * Windows platform builds: TensorFlow on Windows under MSVC is now built with `--copt=/experimental:preprocessor --host_copt=/experimental:preprocessor` (see `.bazelrc` for more details). Builds including TensorFlow may fail with unexpected syntax errors if these flags are absent. See also [this thread on SIG Build](https://groups.google.com/a/tensorflow.org/g/build/c/LbAw8RILvTg/m/ttnuhYU2BgAJ).\r\n\r\n## Known Caveats\r\n  * `tf.keras.mixed_precision`\r\n    * When using mixed precision, calling `RMSprop.apply_gradients` or `Nadam.apply_gradients` outside a `tf.function` does not work and will raise the                 AttributeError \"Tensor.op is meaningless when eager execution is enabled\". See this [issue](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/45536) for           details and a workaround.\r\n\r\n## Bug Fixes and Other Changes\r\n\r\n### TF Core:\r\n  * Introduces experimental support for a new module named [`tf.experimental.numpy`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/experimental/numpy), which\r\n    is a NumPy-compatible API for writing TF programs. This module provides class `ndarray`, which mimics the `ndarray` class in NumPy, and wraps an immutable       `tf.Tensor` under the hood. A subset of NumPy functions (e.g. `numpy.add`) are provided. Their inter-operation with TF facilities is seamless in most cases. \r\n    See [tensorflow/python/ops/numpy_ops/README.md](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/python/ops/numpy_ops/README.md)\r\n    for details of what operations are supported and what are the differences from NumPy.\r\n  * `tf.types.experimental.TensorLike` is a new `Union` type that can be used as type annotation for variables representing a Tensor or a value\r\n    that can be converted to Tensor by `tf.convert_to_tensor`.\r\n  * Calling ops with a python constants or numpy values is now consistent with tf.convert_to_tensor behavior. This avoids operations like\r\n    tf.reshape truncating inputs such as from int64 to int32.\r\n  * Adds `tf.sparse.map_values` to apply a function to the `.value`s of `SparseTensor` arguments.\r\n  * The Python bitwise operators for `Tensor` (`__and__`, `__or__`, `__xor__` and `__invert__` now support non-`bool` arguments and apply\r\n    the corresponding bitwise ops. `bool` arguments continue to be supported and dispatch to logical ops. This brings them more in line with \r\n    Python and NumPy behavior.\r\n  * Adds `tf.SparseTensor.with_values`. This returns a new SparseTensor with the same sparsity pattern, but with new provided values. It is\r\n    similar to the `with_values` function of `RaggedTensor`.\r\n  * Adds `StatelessCase` op, and uses it if none of case branches has stateful ops.\r\n  * Adds `tf.config.experimental.get_memory_usage` to return total memory usage of the device.\r\n  * Adds gradients for `RaggedTensorToVariant` and `RaggedTensorFromVariant`.\r\n  * Improve shape inference of nested function calls by supporting constant folding across Arg nodes which makes more static values available to shape               inference functions.\r\n* `tf.debugging`:\r\n  * `tf.debugging.assert_shapes()` now works on `SparseTensor`s (Fixes [#36268](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/36268)).\r\n* GPU\r\n  * Adds Support for [TensorFloat-32](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2020/05/14/tensorfloat-32-precision-format/) on Ampere based GPUs. \r\n    TensorFloat-32, or TF32 for short, is a math mode for NVIDIA Ampere based GPUs which causes certain float32 ops, such as matrix \r\n    multiplications and convolutions, to run much faster on Ampere GPUs but with reduced precision. This reduced precision has not been found \r\n    to effect convergence quality of deep learning models in practice. TensorFloat-32 is enabled by default, but can be disabled with                 `tf.config.experimental.enable_tensor_float_32_execution`.\r\n* `tf.math`:\r\n  * Adds `tf.math.erfcinv`, the inverse to `tf.math.erfc`.\r\n* `tf.nn`:\r\n  *   `tf.nn.max_pool2d` now supports explicit padding.\r\n* `tf.image`:\r\n  * Adds deterministic `tf.image.stateless_random_*` functions for each `tf.image.random_*` function. Added a new op `stateless_sample_distorted_bounding_box`       which is a deterministic version of `sample_distorted_bounding_box` op. Given the same seed, these stateless functions/ops produce the same results               independent of how many times the function is called, and independent of global seed settings.\r\n  * Adds deterministic `tf.image.resize` backprop CUDA kernels for `method=ResizeMethod.BILINEAR` (the default method). Enable by setting the environment             variable `TF_DETERMINISTIC_OPS` to `\"true\"` or `\"1\"`.\r\n* `tf.print`:\r\n  * Bug fix in `tf.print()` with `OrderedDict` where if an `OrderedDict` didn't have the keys sorted, the keys and values were not being printed\r\n    in accordance with their correct mapping.\r\n* `tf.train.Checkpoint`:\r\n  * Now accepts a `root` argument in the initialization, which generates a checkpoint with a root object. This allows users to create a `Checkpoint` object that     is compatible with Keras `model.save_weights()` and `model.load_weights`. The checkpoint is also compatible with the checkpoint saved in the `variables/`         folder in the SavedModel.\r\n  * When restoring, `save_path` can be a path to a SavedModel. The function will automatically find the checkpoint in the SavedModel.\r\n  \r\n### `tf.data`:\r\n  * Adds new `tf.data.experimental.service.register_dataset` and `tf.data.experimental.service.from_dataset_id` APIs to enable one\r\n    process to register a dataset with the tf.data service, and another process to consume data from the dataset.\r\n  * Adds support for dispatcher fault tolerance. To enable fault tolerance, configure a `work_dir` when running your dispatcher server and set\r\n    `dispatcher_fault_tolerance=True`. The dispatcher will store its state to `work_dir`, so that on restart it can continue from its previous\r\n    state after restart.\r\n  * Adds support for sharing dataset graphs via shared filesystem instead of over RPC. This reduces load on the dispatcher, improving performance\r\n    of distributing datasets. For this to work, the dispatcher's `work_dir` must be accessible from workers. If the worker fails to read from the\r\n    `work_dir`, it falls back to using RPC for dataset graph transfer.\r\n  * Adds support for a new \"distributed_epoch\" processing mode. This processing mode distributes a dataset across all tf.data workers,\r\n    instead of having each worker process the full dataset. See [the tf.data service docs](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/data/experimental/service#understand_processing_mode) to learn more.\r\n  * Adds optional `exclude_cols` parameter to CsvDataset. This parameter is the complement of `select_cols`; at most one of these should be specified.\r\n  * We have implemented an optimization which reorders data-discarding transformations such as `take` and `shard` to happen earlier in the dataset when it is           safe to do so. The optimization can be disabled via the `experimental_optimization.reorder_data_discarding_ops` dataset option.\r\n  * `tf.data.Options` were previously immutable and can now be overridden.\r\n  * `tf.data.Dataset.from_generator` now supports Ragged and Sparse tensors with a new `output_signature` argument, which allows `from_generator` to\r\n    produce any type describable by a `tf.TypeSpec`.\r\n  * `tf.data.experimental.AUTOTUNE` is now available in the core API as `tf.data.AUTOTUNE`.\r\n\r\n### `tf.distribute`:\r\n  * Introduces experimental support for asynchronous training of models via `tf.distribute.experimental.ParameterServerStrategy`:\r\n    * Replaces the existing `tf.distribute.experimental.ParameterServerStrategy` symbol with a new class that is for parameter server training in TF2. Usage of\r\n      the old symbol, usually with Estimator API, should be **replaced** with [`tf.compat.v1.distribute.experimental.ParameterServerStrategy`].\r\n    * Added `tf.distribute.experimental.coordinator.*` namespace, including the main API `ClusterCoordinator` for coordinating the training cluster, the related data structure `RemoteValue` and `PerWorkerValue`.\r\n  * `MultiWorkerMirroredStrategy`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/distribute/MultiWorkerMirroredStrategy) is now a stable API and is no longer considered experimental. Some of the major improvements involve handling peer failure and many bug fixes. Please check out the detailed tutorial on \r\n     [Multi-worer training with Keras](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/distribute/multi_worker_with_keras).    \r\n  * Adds `tf.distribute.Strategy.gather` and `tf.distribute.ReplicaContext.all_gather` APIs to support gathering dense distributed values.\r\n  * Fixes various issues with saving a distributed model.\r\n\r\n### `tf.keras`:\r\n  * Improvements from the Functional API refactoring:\r\n    * Functional model construction does not need to maintain a global workspace graph, removing memory leaks especially when building many\r\n      models or very large models.\r\n    * Functional model construction should be ~8-10% faster on average.\r\n    * Functional models can now contain non-symbolic values in their call inputs inside of the first positional argument.\r\n    * Several classes of TF ops that were not reliably converted to Keras layers during functional API construction should now work, e.g.\r\n      `tf.image.ssim_multiscale`\r\n    * Error messages when Functional API construction goes wrong (and when ops cannot be converted to Keras layers automatically) should be\r\n      clearer and easier to understand.\r\n  * `Optimizer.minimize` can now accept a loss `Tensor` and a `GradientTape` as an alternative to accepting a `callable` loss.\r\n  * Adds `beta` hyperparameter to [FTRL](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/optimizers/Ftrl) optimizer classes (Keras and others) to match [FTRL paper](https://research.google.com/pubs/archive/41159.pdf).  \r\n  * `Optimizer.__init__` now accepts a `gradient_aggregator` to allow for customization of how gradients are aggregated across devices, as well as `gradients_transformers` to allow for custom gradient transformations (such as gradient clipping).\r\n  * Improvements to Keras preprocessing layers:\r\n    * TextVectorization can now accept a vocabulary list or file as an init arg.\r\n    * Normalization can now accept mean and variance values as init args.\r\n  * In `Attention` and `AdditiveAttention` layers, the `call()` method now accepts a `return_attention_scores` argument. When set to\r\n    True, the layer returns the attention scores as an additional output argument.\r\n  * Adds `tf.metrics.log_cosh` and `tf.metrics.logcosh` API entrypoints with the same implementation as their `tf.losses` equivalent.\r\n  * For Keras model, the individual call of `Model.evaluate` uses no cached data for evaluation, while `Model.fit` uses cached data when `validation_data` arg is provided for better performance.\r\n  * Adds a `save_traces` argument to `model.save`/ `tf.keras.models.save_model` which determines whether the SavedModel format stores the Keras model/layer call     functions. The traced functions allow Keras to revive custom models and layers without the original class definition, but if this isn't required the tracing     can be disabled with the added option.\r\n  * The `tf.keras.mixed_precision` API is now non-experimental. The non-experimental API differs from the experimental API in several ways.\r\n    * `tf.keras.mixed_precision.Policy` no longer takes in a `tf.mixed_precision.experimental.LossScale` in the constructor, and no longer has a `LossScale`           associated with it. Instead, `Model.compile` will automatically wrap the optimizer with a `LossScaleOptimizer` using dynamic loss scaling if `Policy.name`       is \"mixed_float16\".\r\n    * `tf.keras.mixed_precision.LossScaleOptimizer`'s constructor takes in different arguments. In particular, it no longer takes in a `LossScale`, and there is       no longer a `LossScale` associated with the `LossScaleOptimizer`. Instead, `LossScaleOptimizer` directly implements fixed or dynamic loss scaling. See the       documentation of [`tf.keras.mixed_precision.experimental.LossScaleOptimizer`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/mixed_precision/experimental/LossScaleOptimizer?version=nightly) for details on the differences between the       experimental `LossScaleOptimizer` and the new non-experimental `LossScaleOptimizer`.\r\n    * `tf.mixed_precision.experimental.LossScale` and its subclasses are deprecated, as all of its functionality now exists within                      `tf.keras.mixed_precision.LossScaleOptimizer`\r\n\r\n### `tf.lite`:\r\n  * `TFLiteConverter`:\r\n    * Support optional flags `inference_input_type` and `inference_output_type` for full integer quantized models. This allows users to modify the model input         and output type to integer types (`tf.int8`, `tf.uint8`) instead of defaulting to float type (`tf.float32`). \r\n  * NNAPI\r\n    * Adds NNAPI Delegation support for requantization use cases by converting the operation into a dequantize-quantize pair.\r\n    * Removes deprecated `Interpreter.setUseNNAPI(boolean)` Java API. Use `Interpreter.Options.setUseNNAPI` instead.\r\n    * Deprecates `Interpreter::UseNNAPI(bool)` C++ API. Use `NnApiDelegate()` and related delegate configuration methods directly.\r\n    * Deprecates `Interpreter::SetAllowFp16PrecisionForFp32(bool)` C++ API. Prefer controlling this via delegate options, e.g. `tflite::StatefulNnApiDelegate::Options::allow_fp16' or `TfLiteGpuDelegateOptionsV2::is_precision_loss_allowed`.\r\n  * GPU\r\n    * GPU acceleration now supports quantized models by default\r\n  * `DynamicBuffer::AddJoinedString()` will now add a separator if the first string to be joined is empty.\r\n  *  Adds support for cumulative sum (cumsum), both as builtin op and MLIR conversion.\r\n  \r\n### `TensorRT`\r\n  * Issues a warning when the `session_config` parameter for the TF1 converter is used or the `rewrite_config_template` field in the TF2\r\n    converter parameter object is used.\r\n    \r\n### TPU Enhancements:\r\n  * Adds support for the `beta` parameter of the FTRL optimizer for TPU embeddings. Users of other TensorFlow platforms can implement equivalent\r\n    behavior by adjusting the `l2` parameter.\r\n\r\n### XLA Support:\r\n  * xla.experimental.compile is deprecated, use `tf.function(experimental_compile=True)` instead. \r\n  * Adds `tf.function.experimental_get_compiler_ir` which returns compiler IR (currently 'hlo' and 'optimized_hlo') for given input for given function.\r\n  \r\n### Security:\r\n  * Fixes an undefined behavior causing a segfault in `tf.raw_ops.Switch`, ([CVE-2020-15190](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-15190))\r\n  * Fixes three vulnerabilities in conversion to DLPack format\r\n    * [CVE-2020-15191](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-15191),\r\n    * [CVE-2020-15192](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-15192),\r\n    * [CVE-2020-15193](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-15193)\r\n  * Fixes two vulnerabilities in `SparseFillEmptyRowsGrad`\r\n    * [CVE-2020-15194](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-15194),\r\n    * [CVE-2020-15195](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-15195)\r\n  * Fixes several vulnerabilities in `RaggedCountSparseOutput` and `SparseCountSparseOutput` operations\r\n    * [CVE-2020-15196](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-15196),\r\n    * [CVE-2020-15197](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-15197),\r\n    * [CVE-2020-15198](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-15198),\r\n    * [CVE-2020-15199](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-15199),\r\n    * [CVE-2020-15200](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-15200),\r\n    * [CVE-2020-15201](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-15201)\r\n  * Fixes an integer truncation vulnerability in code using the work sharder API, ([CVE-2020-15202](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-15202))\r\n  * Fixes a format string vulnerability in `tf.strings.as_string`, ([CVE-2020-15203](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-15203))\r\n  * Fixes segfault raised by calling session-only ops in eager mode, ([CVE-2020-15204](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-15204))\r\n  * Fixes data leak and potential ASLR violation from `tf.raw_ops.StringNGrams`, ([CVE-2020-15205](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-15205))\r\n  * Fixes segfaults caused by incomplete `SavedModel` validation, ([CVE-2020-15206](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-15206))\r\n  * Fixes a data corruption due to a bug in negative indexing support in TFLite, ([CVE-2020-15207](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-15207))\r\n  * Fixes a data corruption due to dimension mismatch in TFLite, ([CVE-2020-15208](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-15208))\r\n  * Fixes several vulnerabilities in TFLite saved model format\r\n    * [CVE-2020-15209](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-15209),\r\n    * [CVE-2020-15210](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-15210),\r\n    * [CVE-2020-15211](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-15211)\r\n  * Fixes several vulnerabilities in TFLite implementation of segment sum\r\n    * [CVE-2020-15212](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-15212),\r\n    * [CVE-2020-15213](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-15213),\r\n    * [CVE-2020-15214](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-15214)\r\n  * Fixes a segfault in `tf.quantization.quantize_and_dequantize`, ([CVE-2020-15265](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-15265))\r\n  * Fixes an undefined behavior float cast causing a crash, ([CVE-2020-15266](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-15266))\r\n  * Fixes a lack of validation in `tf.raw_ops.DataFormatVecPermute` and `tf.raw_ops.DataFormatDimMap` which can cause uninitialized memory access, read outside bounds of arrays, data corruption and segmentation faults ([CVE-2020-26267](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-26267))\r\n  * Fixes a crash caused by writing to read only memory region ([CVE-2020-26268](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-26268))\r\n  * Fixes a heap out of bounds access in filesystem globbing implementation ([CVE-2020-26269](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-26269))\r\n    \r\n### Other:\r\n  * We have replaced uses of \"whitelist\" and \"blacklist\" with \"allowlist\" and \"denylist\" where possible.

    "body": "# Release 2.4.0\r\n\r\n## Major Features and Improvements\r\n\r\n* `tf.distribute` introduces experimental support for asynchronous training of Keras models via the [`tf.distribute.experimental.ParameterServerStrategy`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/distribute/experimental/ParameterServerStrategy?version=nightly) API. Please see below for additional details.\r\n* [`MultiWorkerMirroredStrategy`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/distribute/MultiWorkerMirroredStrategy) is now a stable API and is no longer considered experimental. Some of the major improvements involve handling peer failure and many bug fixes. Please check out the detailed tutorial on [Multi-worker training with Keras](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/distribute/multi_worker_with_keras). \r\n\r\n* Introduces experimental support for a new module named [`tf.experimental.numpy`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/experimental/numpy) which is a NumPy-compatible API for writing TF programs. See the [detailed guide](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/tf_numpy) to learn more. Additional details below. \r\n\r\n* Adds Support for\r\n  [TensorFloat-32](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2020/05/14/tensorfloat-32-precision-format/) on Ampere based GPUs. TensorFloat-32, or TF32 for short, is a math mode for NVIDIA Ampere based GPUs and is enabled by default. \r\n  \r\n* A major refactoring of the internals of the Keras Functional API has been completed, that should improve the reliability, stability, and performance of constructing Functional models.\r\n\r\n* Keras mixed precision API [`tf.keras.mixed_precision`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/mixed_precision?version=nightly) is no longer experimental and allows the use of 16-bit floating point formats during training, improving performance by up to 3x on GPUs and 60% on TPUs. Please see below for additional details.\r\n\r\n* TensorFlow Profiler now supports profiling `MultiWorkerMirroredStrategy` and tracing multiple workers using the [sampling mode API](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/profiler#profiling_apis).\r\n\r\n* TFLite Profiler for Android is available. See the detailed [guide](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/performance/measurement#trace_tensorflow_lite_internals_in_android) to learn more.\r\n\r\n* TensorFlow pip packages are now built with CUDA11 and cuDNN 8.0.2.\r\n\r\n## Breaking Changes\r\n\r\n* TF Core:\r\n  * Certain float32 ops run in lower precision on Ampere based GPUs, including  matmuls and convolutions, due to the use of [TensorFloat-32](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2020/05/14/tensorfloat-32-precision-format/). Specifically, inputs to such ops are rounded from 23 bits of precision to 10\r\n  bits of precision. This is unlikely to cause issues in practice for deep learning models. In some cases, TensorFloat-32 is also used for complex64 ops.\r\n  TensorFloat-32 can be disabled by running `tf.config.experimental.enable_tensor_float_32_execution(False)`. \r\n  * The byte layout for string tensors across the C-API has been updated to match TF Core/C++; i.e., a contiguous array of `tensorflow::tstring`/`TF_TString`s.\r\n  * C-API functions `TF_StringDecode`, `TF_StringEncode`, and `TF_StringEncodedSize` are no longer relevant and have been removed; see `core/platform/ctstring.h` for  string access/modification in C.\r\n  * `tensorflow.python`, `tensorflow.core` and `tensorflow.compiler` modules are now hidden. These modules are not part of TensorFlow public API.\r\n  * `tf.raw_ops.Max` and `tf.raw_ops.Min` no longer accept inputs of type `tf.complex64` or `tf.complex128`, because the behavior of these ops is not well           defined for complex types.\r\n  * XLA:CPU and XLA:GPU devices are no longer registered by default. Use `TF_XLA_FLAGS=--tf_xla_enable_xla_devices` if you really need them, but this flag will eventually be removed in subsequent releases.\r\n\r\n* `tf.keras`:  \r\n  * The `steps_per_execution` argument in `compile()` is no longer experimental; if you were passing `experimental_steps_per_execution`, rename it to         `steps_per_execution` in your code. This argument controls the number of batches to run during each `tf.function` call when calling `fit()`. Running multiple   batches inside a single `tf.function` call can greatly improve performance on TPUs or small models with a large Python overhead.\r\n  * A **major refactoring** of the internals of the Keras Functional API may affect code that\r\n  is relying on certain internal details:\r\n    * Code that uses `isinstance(x, tf.Tensor)` instead of `tf.is_tensor` when checking Keras symbolic inputs/outputs should switch to using `tf.is_tensor`.\r\n    * Code that is overly dependent on the exact names attached to symbolic tensors (e.g. assumes there will be \":0\" at the end of the inputs, treats names as         unique identifiers instead of using `tensor.ref()`, etc.)\r\n    * Code that uses `get_concrete_function` to trace Keras symbolic inputs directly should switch to building matching `tf.TensorSpec`s directly and tracing the       `TensorSpec` objects.\r\n    * Code that relies on the exact number and names of the op layers that TensorFlow operations  were converted into may have changed.\r\n    * Code that uses `tf.map_fn`/`tf.cond`/`tf.while_loop`/control flow as op layers and  happens to work before TF 2.4. These will explicitly be unsupported           now. Converting these ops to Functional API op layers was unreliable before TF 2.4, and prone to erroring incomprehensibly  or being silently buggy.\r\n    * Code that directly asserts on a Keras symbolic value in cases where ops like `tf.rank` used to  return a static or symbolic value depending on if the input       had a fully static shape or not. Now these ops always return symbolic values.\r\n    * Code already susceptible to leaking tensors outside of graphs becomes slightly more likely to do so now.\r\n    * Code that tries directly getting gradients with respect to symbolic Keras inputs/outputs. Use GradientTape on the actual Tensors passed to the already-           constructed model instead.\r\n    * Code that requires very tricky shape manipulation via converted op layers in order to work, where the Keras symbolic shape inference proves insufficient.\r\n    * Code that tries manually walking a `tf.keras.Model` layer by layer and assumes layers only ever have one positional argument. This assumption doesn't hold       true before TF 2.4 either, but is more likely to cause issues now.\r\n    * Code that manually enters `keras.backend.get_graph()` before building a functional model is no longer needed.\r\n    * Start enforcing input shape assumptions when calling Functional API Keras models. This may potentially break some users, in case there is a mismatch             between the shape used when creating `Input` objects in a Functional model, and the shape of the data passed to that model. You can fix this mismatch by         either calling the model with correctly-shaped data, or by relaxing `Input` shape assumptions (note that you can pass shapes with `None` entries for axes\r\n      that are meant to be dynamic). You can also disable the input checking entirely by setting `model.input_spec = None`.\r\n  * Serveral changes have been made to `tf.keras.mixed_precision.experimental`. Note that it is now recommended to use the non-experimental `tf.keras.mixed_precision` API.\r\n    * `AutoCastVariable.dtype` now refers to the actual variable dtype, not the dtype it will be casted to.\r\n    * When mixed precision is enabled, `tf.keras.layers.Embedding` now outputs a float16 or bfloat16 tensor instead of a float32 tensor.\r\n    * The property `tf.keras.mixed_precision.experimental.LossScaleOptimizer.loss_scale` is \r\n      now a tensor, not a `LossScale` object. This means to get a loss scale of a `LossScaleOptimizer` as a tensor, you must now call \r\n     `opt.loss_scale` instead of `opt.loss_scale()`.\r\n    * The property `should_cast_variables` has been removed from `tf.keras.mixed_precision.experimental.Policy`\r\n    * When passing a `tf.mixed_precision.experimental.DynamicLossScale` to\r\n      `tf.keras.mixed_precision.experimental.LossScaleOptimizer`, the `DynamicLossScale`'s multiplier must be 2.\r\n    * When passing a `tf.mixed_precision.experimental.DynamicLossScale` to `tf.keras.mixed_precision.experimental.LossScaleOptimizer`, \r\n     the weights of the `DynanmicLossScale` are copied into the `LossScaleOptimizer` instead of being reused. This means modifying the \r\n      weights of the `DynamicLossScale` will no longer affect the weights of the LossScaleOptimizer, and vice versa.\r\n    * The global policy can no longer be set to a non-floating point policy in `tf.keras.mixed_precision.experimental.set_policy`\r\n    * In `Layer.call`, `AutoCastVariable`s will no longer be casted within `MirroredStrategy.run` or `ReplicaContext.merge_call`. This is \r\n      because a thread local variable is used to determine whether `AutoCastVariable`s are casted, and those two functions run with a \r\n      different thread. Note this only applies if one of these two functions is called within `Layer.call`; if one of those two functions calls `Layer.call`, `AutoCastVariable`s will still be casted.\r\n\r\n* `tf.data`:\r\n  * `tf.data.experimental.service.DispatchServer` now takes a config tuple instead of individual arguments. Usages should be updated to      `tf.data.experimental.service.DispatchServer(dispatcher_config)`.\r\n  * `tf.data.experimental.service.WorkerServer` now takes a config tuple instead of individual arguments. Usages should be updated to  `tf.data.experimental.service.WorkerServer(worker_config)`.\r\n  \r\n* `tf.distribute`:\r\n  * Removes `tf.distribute.Strategy.experimental_make_numpy_dataset`. Please use `tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices` instead.\r\n  * Renames `experimental_hints` in `tf.distribute.StrategyExtended.reduce_to`, `tf.distribute.StrategyExtended.batch_reduce_to`,      `tf.distribute.ReplicaContext.all_reduce` to `options`:\r\n  * Renames `tf.distribute.experimental.CollectiveHints` to `tf.distribute.experimental.CommunicationOptions`.\r\n  * Renames `tf.distribute.experimental.CollectiveCommunication` to `tf.distribute.experimental.CommunicationImplementation`.\r\n  * Renames `tf.distribute.Strategy.experimental_distribute_datasets_from_function` to `distribute_datasets_from_function` as it is no longer experimental. \r\n  * Removes `tf.distribute.Strategy.experimental_run_v2` method, which was deprecated in TF 2.2.\r\n\r\n* `tf.lite`:\r\n  * `tf.quantization.quantize_and_dequantize_v2` has been introduced, which updates the gradient definition for quantization which is outside the range\r\n     to be 0. To simulate the V1 the behavior of `tf.quantization.quantize_and_dequantize(...)` use             `tf.grad_pass_through(tf.quantization.quantize_and_dequantize_v2)(...)`.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Bug Fixes and Other Changes\r\n\r\n### TF Core:\r\n  * Introduces experimental support for a new module named  [`tf.experimental.numpy`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/experimental/numpy), which\r\n    is a NumPy-compatible API for writing TF programs. This module provides class `ndarray`, which mimics the `ndarray` class in NumPy, and wraps an immutable       `tf.Tensor` under the hood. A subset of NumPy functions (e.g. `numpy.add`) are provided. Their inter-operation with TF facilities is seamless in most cases. \r\n    See [tensorflow/python/ops/numpy_ops/README.md](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/python/ops/numpy_ops/README.md)\r\n    for details of what operations are supported and what are the differences from NumPy.\r\n  * `tf.types.experimental.TensorLike` is a new `Union` type that can be used as type annotation for variables representing a Tensor or a value\r\n    that can be converted to Tensor by `tf.convert_to_tensor`.\r\n  * Calling ops with a python constants or numpy values is now consistent with tf.convert_to_tensor behavior. This avoids operations like\r\n    tf.reshape truncating inputs such as from int64 to int32.\r\n  * Adds `tf.sparse.map_values` to apply a function to the `.value`s of `SparseTensor` arguments.\r\n  * The Python bitwise operators for `Tensor` (`__and__`, `__or__`, `__xor__` and `__invert__` now support non-`bool` arguments and apply\r\n    the corresponding bitwise ops. `bool` arguments continue to be supported and dispatch to logical ops. This brings them more in line with \r\n    Python and NumPy behavior.\r\n  * Adds `tf.SparseTensor.with_values`. This returns a new SparseTensor with the same sparsity pattern, but with new provided values. It is\r\n    similar to the `with_values` function of `RaggedTensor`.\r\n  * Adds `StatelessCase` op, and uses it if none of case branches has stateful ops.\r\n  * Adds `tf.config.experimental.get_memory_usage` to return total memory usage of the device.\r\n  * Adds gradients for `RaggedTensorToVariant` and `RaggedTensorFromVariant`.\r\n  * Improve shape inference of nested function calls by supporting constant folding across Arg nodes which makes more static values available to shape inference functions.\r\n* `tf.debugging`:\r\n  * `tf.debugging.assert_shapes()` now works on `SparseTensor`s (Fixes [#36268](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/36268)).\r\n* GPU\r\n  * Adds Support for [TensorFloat-32](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2020/05/14/tensorfloat-32-precision-format/) on Ampere based GPUs. \r\n    TensorFloat-32, or TF32 for short, is a math mode for NVIDIA Ampere based GPUs which causes certain float32 ops, such as matrix \r\n    multiplications and convolutions, to run much faster on Ampere GPUs but with reduced precision. This reduced precision has not been found \r\n    to effect convergence quality of deep learning models in practice. TensorFloat-32 is enabled by default, but can be disabled with                 `tf.config.experimental.enable_tensor_float_32_execution`.\r\n* `tf.math`:\r\n  * Adds `tf.math.erfcinv`, the inverse to `tf.math.erfc`.\r\n* `tf.nn`:\r\n  *   `tf.nn.max_pool2d` now supports explicit padding.\r\n* `tf.image`:\r\n  * Adds deterministic `tf.image.stateless_random_*` functions for each `tf.image.random_*` function. Added a new op `stateless_sample_distorted_bounding_box`       which is a deterministic version of `sample_distorted_bounding_box` op. Given the same seed, these stateless functions/ops produce the same results               independent of how many times the function is called, and independent of global seed settings.\r\n  * Adds deterministic `tf.image.resize` backprop CUDA kernels for `method=ResizeMethod.BILINEAR` (the default method). Enable by setting the environment             variable `TF_DETERMINISTIC_OPS` to `\"true\"` or `\"1\"`.\r\n* `tf.print`:\r\n  * Bug fix in `tf.print()` with `OrderedDict` where if an `OrderedDict` didn't have the keys sorted, the keys and values were not being printed\r\n    in accordance with their correct mapping.\r\n* `tf.train.Checkpoint`:\r\n  * Now accepts a `root` argument in the initialization, which generates a checkpoint with a root object. This allows users to create a `Checkpoint` object that     is compatible with Keras `model.save_weights()` and `model.load_weights`. The checkpoint is also compatible with the checkpoint saved in the `variables/`         folder in the SavedModel.\r\n  * When restoring, `save_path` can be a path to a SavedModel. The function will automatically find the checkpoint in the SavedModel.\r\n  \r\n### `tf.data`:\r\n  * Adds new `tf.data.experimental.service.register_dataset` and `tf.data.experimental.service.from_dataset_id` APIs to enable one\r\n    process to register a dataset with the tf.data service, and another process to consume data from the dataset.\r\n  * Adds support for dispatcher fault tolerance. To enable fault tolerance, configure a `work_dir` when running your dispatcher server and set\r\n    `dispatcher_fault_tolerance=True`. The dispatcher will store its state to `work_dir`, so that on restart it can continue from its previous\r\n    state after restart.\r\n  * Adds support for sharing dataset graphs via shared filesystem instead of over RPC. This reduces load on the dispatcher, improving performance\r\n    of distributing datasets. For this to work, the dispatcher's `work_dir` must be accessible from workers. If the worker fails to read from the\r\n    `work_dir`, it falls back to using RPC for dataset graph transfer.\r\n  * Adds support for a new \"distributed_epoch\" processing mode. This processing mode distributes a dataset across all tf.data workers,\r\n    instead of having each worker process the full dataset. See [the tf.data service docs](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/data/experimental/service#understand_processing_mode) to learn more.\r\n  * Adds optional `exclude_cols` parameter to CsvDataset. This parameter is the complement of `select_cols`; at most one of these should be specified.\r\n  * We have implemented an optimization which reorders data-discarding transformations such as `take` and `shard` to happen earlier in the dataset when it is           safe to do so. The optimization can be disabled via the `experimental_optimization.reorder_data_discarding_ops` dataset option.\r\n  * `tf.data.Options` were previously immutable and can now be overridden.\r\n  * `tf.data.Dataset.from_generator` now supports Ragged and Sparse tensors with a new `output_signature` argument, which allows `from_generator` to\r\n    produce any type describable by a `tf.TypeSpec`.\r\n  * `tf.data.experimental.AUTOTUNE` is now available in the core API as `tf.data.AUTOTUNE`.\r\n\r\n### `tf.distribute`:\r\n  * Introduces experimental support for asynchronous training of Keras models via `tf.distribute.experimental.ParameterServerStrategy`:\r\n    * Replaces the existing `tf.distribute.experimental.ParameterServerStrategy` symbol with a new class that is for parameter server training in TF2. Usage of\r\n      the old symbol, usually with Estimator API, should be **replaced** with [`tf.compat.v1.distribute.experimental.ParameterServerStrategy`].\r\n    * Added `tf.distribute.experimental.coordinator.*` namespace, including the main API `ClusterCoordinator` for coordinating the training cluster, the related       data structure `RemoteValue` and `PerWorkerValue`.\r\n  * Adds `tf.distribute.Strategy.gather` and `tf.distribute.ReplicaContext.all_gather` APIs to support gathering dense distributed values.\r\n  * Fixes various issues with saving a distributed model.\r\n\r\n### `tf.keras`:\r\n  * Improvements from the Functional API refactoring:\r\n    * Functional model construction does not need to maintain a global workspace graph, removing memory leaks especially when building many\r\n      models or very large models.\r\n    * Functional model construction should be ~8-10% faster on average.\r\n    * Functional models can now contain non-symbolic values in their call inputs inside of the first positional argument.\r\n    * Several classes of TF ops that were not reliably converted to Keras layers during functional API construction should now work, e.g.\r\n      `tf.image.ssim_multiscale`\r\n    * Error messages when Functional API construction goes wrong (and when ops cannot be converted to Keras layers automatically) should be\r\n      clearer and easier to understand.\r\n  * `Optimizer.minimize` can now accept a loss `Tensor` and a `GradientTape` as an alternative to accepting a `callable` loss.\r\n  * Adds `beta` hyperparameter to FTRL optimizer classes (Keras and others) to match [FTRL paper](https://research.google.com/pubs/archive/41159.pdf).  \r\n  * `Optimizer.__init__` now accepts a `gradient_aggregator` to allow for customization of how gradients are aggregated across devices, as well as\r\n     `gradients_transformers` to allow for custom gradient transformations (such as gradient clipping).\r\n  * Improvements to Keras preprocessing layers:\r\n    * TextVectorization can now accept a vocabulary list or file as an init arg.\r\n    * Normalization can now accept mean and variance values as init args.\r\n  * In `Attention` and `AdditiveAttention` layers, the `call()` method now accepts a `return_attention_scores` argument. When set to\r\n    True, the layer returns the attention scores as an additional output argument.\r\n  * Adds `tf.metrics.log_cosh` and `tf.metrics.logcosh` API entrypoints with the same implementation as their `tf.losses` equivalent.\r\n  * For Keras model, the individual call of `Model.evaluate` uses no cached data for evaluation, while `Model.fit` uses cached data when\r\n    `validation_data` arg is provided for better performance.\r\n  * Adds a `save_traces` argument to `model.save`/ `tf.keras.models.save_model` which determines whether the SavedModel format stores the Keras model/layer call     functions. The traced functions allow Keras to revive custom models and layers without the original class definition, but if this isn't required the tracing can be disabled with the added option.\r\n  * The `tf.keras.mixed_precision` API is non non-experimental. The\r\n    non-experimental API differs from the experimental API in several ways.\r\n    * `tf.keras.mixed_precision.Policy` no longer takes in a\r\n      `tf.mixed_precision.experimental.LossScale` in the constructor, and no\r\n      longer has a `LossScale` associated with it. Instead, `Model.compile`\r\n      will automatically wrap the optimizer with a `LossScaleOptimizer` using\r\n      dynamic loss scaling if `Policy.name` is \"mixed_float16\".\r\n    * `tf.keras.mixed_precision.LossScaleOptimizer`'s constructor takes in\r\n      different arguments. In particular, it no longer takes in a `LossScale`,\r\n      and there is no longer a `LossScale` associated with the\r\n      `LossScaleOptimizer`. Instead, `LossScaleOptimizer` directly implements\r\n      fixed or dynamic loss scaling. See the documentation of\r\n      [`tf.keras.mixed_precision.experimental.LossScaleOptimizer`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/mixed_precision/experimental/LossScaleOptimizer?version=nightly)\r\n      for details on the differences between the experimental\r\n      `LossScaleOptimizer` and the new non-experimental `LossScaleOptimizer`.\r\n    * `tf.mixed_precision.experimental.LossScale` and its subclasses are\r\n      deprecated, as all of its functionality now exists within\r\n      `tf.keras.mixed_precision.LossScaleOptimizer`\r\n\r\n### `tf.lite`:\r\n  * `TFLiteConverter`:\r\n    * Support optional flags `inference_input_type` and `inference_output_type` for full integer quantized models. This allows users to modify the model input         and output type to integer types (`tf.int8`, `tf.uint8`) instead of defaulting to float type (`tf.float32`). \r\n  * NNAPI\r\n    * Adds NNAPI Delegation support for requantization use cases by converting the operation into a dequantize-quantize pair.\r\n    * Removes deprecated `Interpreter.setUseNNAPI(boolean)` Java API. Use `Interpreter.Options.setUseNNAPI` instead.\r\n    * Deprecates `Interpreter::UseNNAPI(bool)` C++ API. Use `NnApiDelegate()` and related delegate configuration methods directly.\r\n    * Deprecates `Interpreter::SetAllowFp16PrecisionForFp32(bool)` C++ API. Prefer controlling this via delegate options, e.g. `tflite::StatefulNnApiDelegate::Options::allow_fp16' or `TfLiteGpuDelegateOptionsV2::is_precision_loss_allowed`.\r\n  * GPU\r\n    * GPU acceleration now supports quantized models by default\r\n  * `DynamicBuffer::AddJoinedString()` will now add a separator if the first string to be joined is empty.\r\n  *  Adds support for cumulative sum (cumsum), both as builtin op and MLIR conversion.\r\n  \r\n### `TensorRT`\r\n  * Issues a warning when the `session_config` parameter for the TF1 converter is used or the `rewrite_config_template` field in the TF2\r\n    converter parameter object is used.\r\n    \r\n### TPU Enhancements:\r\n  * Adds support for the `beta` parameter of the FTRL optimizer for TPU embeddings. Users of other TensorFlow platforms can implement equivalent\r\n    behavior by adjusting the `l2` parameter.\r\n\r\n### XLA Support:\r\n  * xla.experimental.compile is deprecated, use `tf.function(experimental_compile=True)` instead. \r\n  * Adds `tf.function.experimental_get_compiler_ir` which returns compiler IR (currently 'hlo' and 'optimized_hlo') for given input for given function.\r\n  \r\n### Security:\r\n  * Fixes an undefined behavior causing a segfault in `tf.raw_ops.Switch`, ([CVE-2020-15190](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-15190))\r\n  * Fixes three vulnerabilities in conversion to DLPack format\r\n    * [CVE-2020-15191](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-15191),\r\n    * [CVE-2020-15192](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-15192),\r\n    * [CVE-2020-15193](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-15193)\r\n  * Fixes two vulnerabilities in `SparseFillEmptyRowsGrad`\r\n    * [CVE-2020-15194](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-15194),\r\n    * [CVE-2020-15195](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-15195)\r\n  * Fixes several vulnerabilities in `RaggedCountSparseOutput` and `SparseCountSparseOutput` operations\r\n    * [CVE-2020-15196](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-15196),\r\n    * [CVE-2020-15197](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-15197),\r\n    * [CVE-2020-15198](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-15198),\r\n    * [CVE-2020-15199](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-15199),\r\n    * [CVE-2020-15200](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-15200),\r\n    * [CVE-2020-15201](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-15201)\r\n  * Fixes an integer truncation vulnerability in code using the work sharder API, ([CVE-2020-15202](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-15202))\r\n  * Fixes a format string vulnerability in `tf.strings.as_string`, ([CVE-2020-15203](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-15203))\r\n  * Fixes segfault raised by calling session-only ops in eager mode, ([CVE-2020-15204](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-15204))\r\n  * Fixes data leak and potential ASLR violation from `tf.raw_ops.StringNGrams`, ([CVE-2020-15205](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-15205))\r\n  * Fixes segfaults caused by incomplete `SavedModel` validation, ([CVE-2020-15206](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-15206))\r\n  * Fixes a data corruption due to a bug in negative indexing support in TFLite, ([CVE-2020-15207](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-15207))\r\n  * Fixes a data corruption due to dimension mismatch in TFLite, ([CVE-2020-15208](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-15208))\r\n  * Fixes several vulnerabilities in TFLite saved model format\r\n    * [CVE-2020-15209](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-15209),\r\n    * [CVE-2020-15210](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-15210),\r\n    * [CVE-2020-15211](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-15211)\r\n  * Fixes several vulnerabilities in TFLite implementation of segment sum\r\n    * [CVE-2020-15212](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-15212),\r\n    * [CVE-2020-15213](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-15213),\r\n    * [CVE-2020-15214](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-15214)\r\n  * Fixes a segfault in `tf.quantization.quantize_and_dequantize`, ([CVE-2020-15265](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-15265))\r\n  * Fixes an undefined behavior float cast causing a crash, ([CVE-2020-15266](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-15266))\r\n    \r\n### Other:\r\n  * We have replaced uses of \"whitelist\" and \"blacklist\" with \"allowlist\" and \"denylist\" where possible.

    "body": "# Release 2.4.0\r\n\r\n## Major Features and Improvements\r\n\r\n* `tf.distribute` introduces experimental support for asynchronous training of Keras models via the [`tf.distribute.experimental.ParameterServerStrategy`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/distribute/experimental/ParameterServerStrategy?version=nightly) API. Please see below for additional details.\r\n* [`MultiWorkerMirroredStrategy`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/distribute/MultiWorkerMirroredStrategy) is now a stable API and is no longer considered experimental. Some of the major improvements involve handling peer failure and many bug fixes. Please check out the detailed tutorial on [Multi-worker training with Keras](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/distribute/multi_worker_with_keras). \r\n\r\n* Introduces experimental support for a new module named [`tf.experimental.numpy`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/experimental/numpy) which is a NumPy-compatible API for writing TF programs. See the [detailed guide](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/tf_numpy) to learn more. Additional details below. \r\n\r\n* Adds Support for\r\n  [TensorFloat-32](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2020/05/14/tensorfloat-32-precision-format/) on Ampere based GPUs. TensorFloat-32, or TF32 for short, is a math mode for NVIDIA Ampere based GPUs and is enabled by default. \r\n  \r\n* A major refactoring of the internals of the Keras Functional API has been completed, that should improve the reliability, stability, and performance of constructing Functional models.\r\n\r\n* Keras mixed precision API [`tf.keras.mixed_precision`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/mixed_precision?version=nightly) is no longer experimental and allows the use of 16-bit floating point formats during training, improving performance by up to 3x on GPUs and 60% on TPUs. Please see below for additional details.\r\n\r\n* TensorFlow Profiler now supports profiling `MultiWorkerMirroredStrategy` and tracing multiple workers using the [sampling mode API](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/profiler#profiling_apis).\r\n\r\n* TFLite Profiler for Android is available. See the detailed [guide](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/performance/measurement#trace_tensorflow_lite_internals_in_android) to learn more.\r\n\r\n* TensorFlow pip packages are now built with CUDA11 and cuDNN 8.0.2.\r\n\r\n## Breaking Changes\r\n\r\n* TF Core:\r\n  * Certain float32 ops run in lower precsion on Ampere based GPUs, including  matmuls and convolutions, due to the use of [TensorFloat-32](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2020/05/14/tensorfloat-32-precision-format/). Specifically, inputs to such ops are rounded from 23 bits of precision to 10\r\n  bits of precision. This is unlikely to cause issues in practice for deep learning models. In some cases, TensorFloat-32 is also used for complex64 ops.\r\n  TensorFloat-32 can be disabled by running `tf.config.experimental.enable_tensor_float_32_execution(False)`. \r\n  * The byte layout for string tensors across the C-API has been updated to match TF Core/C++; i.e., a contiguous array of `tensorflow::tstring`/`TF_TString`s.\r\n  * C-API functions `TF_StringDecode`, `TF_StringEncode`, and `TF_StringEncodedSize` are no longer relevant and have been removed; see `core/platform/ctstring.h` for  string access/modification in C.\r\n  * `tensorflow.python`, `tensorflow.core` and `tensorflow.compiler` modules are now hidden. These modules are not part of TensorFlow public API.\r\n  * `tf.raw_ops.Max` and `tf.raw_ops.Min` no longer accept inputs of type `tf.complex64` or `tf.complex128`, because the behavior of these ops is not well           defined for complex types.\r\n  * XLA:CPU and XLA:GPU devices are no longer registered by default. Use `TF_XLA_FLAGS=--tf_xla_enable_xla_devices` if you really need them, but this flag will eventually be removed in subsequent releases.\r\n\r\n* `tf.keras`:  \r\n  * The `steps_per_execution` argument in `compile()` is no longer experimental; if you were passing `experimental_steps_per_execution`, rename it to         `steps_per_execution` in your code. This argument controls the number of batches to run during each `tf.function` call when calling `fit()`. Running multiple   batches inside a single `tf.function` call can greatly improve performance on TPUs or small models with a large Python overhead.\r\n  * A **major refactoring** of the internals of the Keras Functional API may affect code that\r\n  is relying on certain internal details:\r\n    * Code that uses `isinstance(x, tf.Tensor)` instead of `tf.is_tensor` when checking Keras symbolic inputs/outputs should switch to using `tf.is_tensor`.\r\n    * Code that is overly dependent on the exact names attached to symbolic tensors (e.g. assumes there will be \":0\" at the end of the inputs, treats names as         unique identifiers instead of using `tensor.ref()`, etc.)\r\n    * Code that uses `get_concrete_function` to trace Keras symbolic inputs directly should switch to building matching `tf.TensorSpec`s directly and tracing the       `TensorSpec` objects.\r\n    * Code that relies on the exact number and names of the op layers that TensorFlow operations  were converted into may have changed.\r\n    * Code that uses `tf.map_fn`/`tf.cond`/`tf.while_loop`/control flow as op layers and  happens to work before TF 2.4. These will explicitly be unsupported           now. Converting these ops to Functional API op layers was unreliable before TF 2.4, and prone to erroring incomprehensibly  or being silently buggy.\r\n    * Code that directly asserts on a Keras symbolic value in cases where ops like `tf.rank` used to  return a static or symbolic value depending on if the input       had a fully static shape or not. Now these ops always return symbolic values.\r\n    * Code already susceptible to leaking tensors outside of graphs becomes slightly more likely to do so now.\r\n    * Code that tries directly getting gradients with respect to symbolic Keras inputs/outputs. Use GradientTape on the actual Tensors passed to the already-           constructed model instead.\r\n    * Code that requires very tricky shape manipulation via converted op layers in order to work, where the Keras symbolic shape inference proves insufficient.\r\n    * Code that tries manually walking a `tf.keras.Model` layer by layer and assumes layers only ever have one positional argument. This assumption doesn't hold       true before TF 2.4 either, but is more likely to cause issues now.\r\n    * Code that manually enters `keras.backend.get_graph()` before building a functional model is no longer needed.\r\n    * Start enforcing input shape assumptions when calling Functional API Keras models. This may potentially break some users, in case there is a mismatch             between the shape used when creating `Input` objects in a Functional model, and the shape of the data passed to that model. You can fix this mismatch by         either calling the model with correctly-shaped data, or by relaxing `Input` shape assumptions (note that you can pass shapes with `None` entries for axes\r\n      that are meant to be dynamic). You can also disable the input checking entirely by setting `model.input_spec = None`.\r\n  * Serveral changes have been made to `tf.keras.mixed_precision.experimental`. Note that it is now recommended to use the non-experimental `tf.keras.mixed_precision` API.\r\n    * `AutoCastVariable.dtype` now refers to the actual variable dtype, not the dtype it will be casted to.\r\n    * When mixed precision is enabled, `tf.keras.layers.Embedding` now outputs a float16 or bfloat16 tensor instead of a float32 tensor.\r\n    * The property `tf.keras.mixed_precision.experimental.LossScaleOptimizer.loss_scale` is \r\n      now a tensor, not a `LossScale` object. This means to get a loss scale of a `LossScaleOptimizer` as a tensor, you must now call \r\n     `opt.loss_scale` instead of `opt.loss_scale()`.\r\n    * The property `should_cast_variables` has been removed from `tf.keras.mixed_precision.experimental.Policy`\r\n    * When passing a `tf.mixed_precision.experimental.DynamicLossScale` to\r\n      `tf.keras.mixed_precision.experimental.LossScaleOptimizer`, the `DynamicLossScale`'s multiplier must be 2.\r\n    * When passing a `tf.mixed_precision.experimental.DynamicLossScale` to `tf.keras.mixed_precision.experimental.LossScaleOptimizer`, \r\n     the weights of the `DynanmicLossScale` are copied into the `LossScaleOptimizer` instead of being reused. This means modifying the \r\n      weights of the `DynamicLossScale` will no longer affect the weights of the LossScaleOptimizer, and vice versa.\r\n    * The global policy can no longer be set to a non-floating point policy in `tf.keras.mixed_precision.experimental.set_policy`\r\n    * In `Layer.call`, `AutoCastVariable`s will no longer be casted within `MirroredStrategy.run` or `ReplicaContext.merge_call`. This is \r\n      because a thread local variable is used to determine whether `AutoCastVariable`s are casted, and those two functions run with a \r\n      different thread. Note this only applies if one of these two functions is called within `Layer.call`; if one of those two functions calls `Layer.call`, `AutoCastVariable`s will still be casted.\r\n\r\n* `tf.data`:\r\n  * `tf.data.experimental.service.DispatchServer` now takes a config tuple instead of individual arguments. Usages should be updated to      `tf.data.experimental.service.DispatchServer(dispatcher_config)`.\r\n  * `tf.data.experimental.service.WorkerServer` now takes a config tuple instead of individual arguments. Usages should be updated to  `tf.data.experimental.service.WorkerServer(worker_config)`.\r\n  \r\n* `tf.distribute`:\r\n  * Removes `tf.distribute.Strategy.experimental_make_numpy_dataset`. Please use `tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices` instead.\r\n  * Renames `experimental_hints` in `tf.distribute.StrategyExtended.reduce_to`, `tf.distribute.StrategyExtended.batch_reduce_to`,      `tf.distribute.ReplicaContext.all_reduce` to `options`:\r\n  * Renames `tf.distribute.experimental.CollectiveHints` to `tf.distribute.experimental.CommunicationOptions`.\r\n  * Renames `tf.distribute.experimental.CollectiveCommunication` to `tf.distribute.experimental.CommunicationImplementation`.\r\n  * Renames `tf.distribute.Strategy.experimental_distribute_datasets_from_function` to `distribute_datasets_from_function` as it is no longer experimental. \r\n  * Removes `tf.distribute.Strategy.experimental_run_v2` method, which was deprecated in TF 2.2.\r\n\r\n* `tf.lite`:\r\n  * `tf.quantization.quantize_and_dequantize_v2` has been introduced, which updates the gradient definition for quantization which is outside the range\r\n     to be 0. To simulate the V1 the behavior of `tf.quantization.quantize_and_dequantize(...)` use             `tf.grad_pass_through(tf.quantization.quantize_and_dequantize_v2)(...)`.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Bug Fixes and Other Changes\r\n\r\n### TF Core:\r\n  * Introduces experimental support for a new module named  [`tf.experimental.numpy`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/experimental/numpy), which\r\n    is a NumPy-compatible API for writing TF programs. This module provides class `ndarray`, which mimics the `ndarray` class in NumPy, and wraps an immutable       `tf.Tensor` under the hood. A subset of NumPy functions (e.g. `numpy.add`) are provided. Their inter-operation with TF facilities is seamless in most cases. \r\n    See [tensorflow/python/ops/numpy_ops/README.md](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/python/ops/numpy_ops/README.md)\r\n    for details of what operations are supported and what are the differences from NumPy.\r\n  * `tf.types.experimental.TensorLike` is a new `Union` type that can be used as type annotation for variables representing a Tensor or a value\r\n    that can be converted to Tensor by `tf.convert_to_tensor`.\r\n  * Calling ops with a python constants or numpy values is now consistent with tf.convert_to_tensor behavior. This avoids operations like\r\n    tf.reshape truncating inputs such as from int64 to int32.\r\n  * Adds `tf.sparse.map_values` to apply a function to the `.value`s of `SparseTensor` arguments.\r\n  * The Python bitwise operators for `Tensor` (`__and__`, `__or__`, `__xor__` and `__invert__` now support non-`bool` arguments and apply\r\n    the corresponding bitwise ops. `bool` arguments continue to be supported and dispatch to logical ops. This brings them more in line with \r\n    Python and NumPy behavior.\r\n  * Adds `tf.SparseTensor.with_values`. This returns a new SparseTensor with the same sparsity pattern, but with new provided values. It is\r\n    similar to the `with_values` function of `RaggedTensor`.\r\n  * Adds `StatelessCase` op, and uses it if none of case branches has stateful ops.\r\n  * Adds `tf.config.experimental.get_memory_usage` to return total memory usage of the device.\r\n  * Adds gradients for `RaggedTensorToVariant` and `RaggedTensorFromVariant`.\r\n  * Improve shape inference of nested function calls by supporting constant folding across Arg nodes which makes more static values available to shape               inference functions.\r\n* `tf.debugging`:\r\n  * `tf.debugging.assert_shapes()` now works on `SparseTensor`s (Fixes [#36268](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/36268)).\r\n* GPU\r\n  * Adds Support for [TensorFloat-32](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2020/05/14/tensorfloat-32-precision-format/) on Ampere based GPUs. \r\n    TensorFloat-32, or TF32 for short, is a math mode for NVIDIA Ampere based GPUs which causes certain float32 ops, such as matrix \r\n    multiplications and convolutions, to run much faster on Ampere GPUs but with reduced precision. This reduced precision has not been found \r\n    to effect convergence quality of deep learning models in practice. TensorFloat-32 is enabled by default, but can be disabled with                 `tf.config.experimental.enable_tensor_float_32_execution`.\r\n* `tf.math`:\r\n  * Adds `tf.math.erfcinv`, the inverse to `tf.math.erfc`.\r\n* `tf.nn`:\r\n  *   `tf.nn.max_pool2d` now supports explicit padding.\r\n* `tf.image`:\r\n  * Adds deterministic `tf.image.stateless_random_*` functions for each `tf.image.random_*` function. Added a new op `stateless_sample_distorted_bounding_box`       which is a deterministic version of `sample_distorted_bounding_box` op. Given the same seed, these stateless functions/ops produce the same results               independent of how many times the function is called, and independent of global seed settings.\r\n  * Adds deterministic `tf.image.resize` backprop CUDA kernels for `method=ResizeMethod.BILINEAR` (the default method). Enable by setting the environment             variable `TF_DETERMINISTIC_OPS` to `\"true\"` or `\"1\"`.\r\n* `tf.print`:\r\n  * Bug fix in `tf.print()` with `OrderedDict` where if an `OrderedDict` didn't have the keys sorted, the keys and values were not being printed\r\n    in accordance with their correct mapping.\r\n* `tf.train.Checkpoint`:\r\n  * Now accepts a `root` argument in the initialization, which generates a checkpoint with a root object. This allows users to create a `Checkpoint` object that     is compatible with Keras `model.save_weights()` and `model.load_weights`. The checkpoint is also compatible with the checkpoint saved in the `variables/`         folder in the SavedModel.\r\n  * When restoring, `save_path` can be a path to a SavedModel. The function will automatically find the checkpoint in the SavedModel.\r\n  \r\n### `tf.data`:\r\n  * Adds new `tf.data.experimental.service.register_dataset` and `tf.data.experimental.service.from_dataset_id` APIs to enable one\r\n    process to register a dataset with the tf.data service, and another process to consume data from the dataset.\r\n  * Adds support for dispatcher fault tolerance. To enable fault tolerance, configure a `work_dir` when running your dispatcher server and set\r\n    `dispatcher_fault_tolerance=True`. The dispatcher will store its state to `work_dir`, so that on restart it can continue from its previous\r\n    state after restart.\r\n  * Adds support for sharing dataset graphs via shared filesystem instead of over RPC. This reduces load on the dispatcher, improving performance\r\n    of distributing datasets. For this to work, the dispatcher's `work_dir` must be accessible from workers. If the worker fails to read from the\r\n    `work_dir`, it falls back to using RPC for dataset graph transfer.\r\n  * Adds support for a new \"distributed_epoch\" processing mode. This processing mode distributes a dataset across all tf.data workers,\r\n    instead of having each worker process the full dataset. See [the tf.data service docs](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/data/experimental/service#understand_processing_mode) to learn more.\r\n  * Adds optional `exclude_cols` parameter to CsvDataset. This parameter is the complement of `select_cols`; at most one of these should be specified.\r\n  * We have implemented an optimization which reorders data-discarding transformations such as `take` and `shard` to happen earlier in the dataset when it is           safe to do so. The optimization can be disabled via the `experimental_optimization.reorder_data_discarding_ops` dataset option.\r\n  * `tf.data.Options` were previously immutable and can now be overridden.\r\n  * `tf.data.Dataset.from_generator` now supports Ragged and Sparse tensors with a new `output_signature` argument, which allows `from_generator` to\r\n    produce any type describable by a `tf.TypeSpec`.\r\n  * `tf.data.experimental.AUTOTUNE` is now available in the core API as `tf.data.AUTOTUNE`.\r\n\r\n### `tf.distribute`:\r\n  * Introduces experimental support for asynchronous training of Keras models via `tf.distribute.experimental.ParameterServerStrategy`:\r\n    * Replaces the existing `tf.distribute.experimental.ParameterServerStrategy` symbol with a new class that is for parameter server training in TF2. Usage of\r\n      the old symbol, usually with Estimator API, should be **replaced** with [`tf.compat.v1.distribute.experimental.ParameterServerStrategy`].\r\n    * Added `tf.distribute.experimental.coordinator.*` namespace, including the main API `ClusterCoordinator` for coordinating the training cluster, the related       data structure `RemoteValue` and `PerWorkerValue`.\r\n  * Adds `tf.distribute.Strategy.gather` and `tf.distribute.ReplicaContext.all_gather` APIs to support gathering dense distributed values.\r\n  * Fixes various issues with saving a distributed model.\r\n\r\n### `tf.keras`:\r\n  * Improvements from the Functional API refactoring:\r\n    * Functional model construction does not need to maintain a global workspace graph, removing memory leaks especially when building many\r\n      models or very large models.\r\n    * Functional model construction should be ~8-10% faster on average.\r\n    * Functional models can now contain non-symbolic values in their call inputs inside of the first positional argument.\r\n    * Several classes of TF ops that were not reliably converted to Keras layers during functional API construction should now work, e.g.\r\n      `tf.image.ssim_multiscale`\r\n    * Error messages when Functional API construction goes wrong (and when ops cannot be converted to Keras layers automatically) should be\r\n      clearer and easier to understand.\r\n  * `Optimizer.minimize` can now accept a loss `Tensor` and a `GradientTape` as an alternative to accepting a `callable` loss.\r\n  * Adds `beta` hyperparameter to FTRL optimizer classes (Keras and others) to match [FTRL paper](https://research.google.com/pubs/archive/41159.pdf).  \r\n  * `Optimizer.__init__` now accepts a `gradient_aggregator` to allow for customization of how gradients are aggregated across devices, as well as\r\n     `gradients_transformers` to allow for custom gradient transformations (such as gradient clipping).\r\n  * Improvements to Keras preprocessing layers:\r\n    * TextVectorization can now accept a vocabulary list or file as an init arg.\r\n    * Normalization can now accept mean and variance values as init args.\r\n  * In `Attention` and `AdditiveAttention` layers, the `call()` method now accepts a `return_attention_scores` argument. When set to\r\n    True, the layer returns the attention scores as an additional output argument.\r\n  * Adds `tf.metrics.log_cosh` and `tf.metrics.logcosh` API entrypoints with the same implementation as their `tf.losses` equivalent.\r\n  * For Keras model, the individual call of `Model.evaluate` uses no cached data for evaluation, while `Model.fit` uses cached data when\r\n    `validation_data` arg is provided for better performance.\r\n  * Adds a `save_traces` argument to `model.save`/ `tf.keras.models.save_model` which determines whether the SavedModel format stores the Keras model/layer call     functions. The traced functions allow Keras to revive custom models and layers without the original class definition, but if this isn't required the tracing     can be disabled with the added option.\r\n  * The `tf.keras.mixed_precision` API is non non-experimental. The\r\n    non-experimental API differs from the experimental API in several ways.\r\n    * `tf.keras.mixed_precision.Policy` no longer takes in a\r\n      `tf.mixed_precision.experimental.LossScale` in the constructor, and no\r\n      longer has a `LossScale` associated with it. Instead, `Model.compile`\r\n      will automatically wrap the optimizer with a `LossScaleOptimizer` using\r\n      dynamic loss scaling if `Policy.name` is \"mixed_float16\".\r\n    * `tf.keras.mixed_precision.LossScaleOptimizer`'s constructor takes in\r\n      different arguments. In particular, it no longer takes in a `LossScale`,\r\n      and there is no longer a `LossScale` associated with the\r\n      `LossScaleOptimizer`. Instead, `LossScaleOptimizer` directly implements\r\n      fixed or dynamic loss scaling. See the documentation of\r\n      [`tf.keras.mixed_precision.experimental.LossScaleOptimizer`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/mixed_precision/experimental/LossScaleOptimizer?version=nightly)\r\n      for details on the differences between the experimental\r\n      `LossScaleOptimizer` and the new non-experimental `LossScaleOptimizer`.\r\n    * `tf.mixed_precision.experimental.LossScale` and its subclasses are\r\n      deprecated, as all of its functionality now exists within\r\n      `tf.keras.mixed_precision.LossScaleOptimizer`\r\n\r\n### `tf.lite`:\r\n  * `TFLiteConverter`:\r\n    * Support optional flags `inference_input_type` and `inference_output_type` for full integer quantized models. This allows users to modify the model input         and output type to integer types (`tf.int8`, `tf.uint8`) instead of defaulting to float type (`tf.float32`). \r\n  * NNAPI\r\n    * Adds NNAPI Delegation support for requantization use cases by converting the operation into a dequantize-quantize pair.\r\n    * Removes deprecated `Interpreter.setUseNNAPI(boolean)` Java API. Use `Interpreter.Options.setUseNNAPI` instead.\r\n    * Deprecates `Interpreter::UseNNAPI(bool)` C++ API.

    "body": "# Release 2.4.0\r\n\r\n## Major Features and Improvements\r\n\r\n* `tf.distribute` introduces experimental support for asynchronous training of Keras models via the [`tf.distribute.experimental.ParameterServerStrategy`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/distribute/experimental/ParameterServerStrategy?version=nightly) API. Please see below for additional details.\r\n* [`MultiWorkerMirroredStrategy`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/distribute/MultiWorkerMirroredStrategy) is now a stable API and is no longer considered experimental. Some of the major improvements involve handling peer failure and many bug fixes. Please check out the detailed tutorial on [Multi-worker training with Keras](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/distribute/multi_worker_with_keras). \r\n\r\n* Introduces experimental support for a new module named [`tf.experimental.numpy`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/experimental/numpy) which is a NumPy-compatible API for writing TF programs. See the [detailed guide](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/tf_numpy) to learn more. Additional details below. \r\n\r\n* Adds Support for\r\n  [TensorFloat-32](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2020/05/14/tensorfloat-32-precision-format/) on Ampere based GPUs. TensorFloat-32, or TF32 for short, is a math mode for NVIDIA Ampere based GPUs and is enabled by default. \r\n  \r\n* A major refactoring of the internals of the Keras Functional API has been completed, that should improve the reliability, stability, and performance of constructing Functional models.\r\n\r\n* Keras mixed precision API [`tf.keras.mixed_precision`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/mixed_precision?version=nightly) is no longer experimental and allows the use of 16-bit floating point formats during training, improving performance by up to 3x on GPUs and 60% on TPUs. Please see below for additional details.\r\n\r\n* TensorFlow Profiler now supports profiling `MultiWorkerMirroredStrategy` and tracing multiple workers using the [sampling mode API](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/profiler#profiling_apis).\r\n\r\n* TFLite Profiler for Android is available. See the detailed [guide](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/performance/measurement#trace_tensorflow_lite_internals_in_android) to learn more.\r\n\r\n* TensorFlow pip packages are now built with CUDA11 and cuDNN 8.0.2.\r\n\r\n## Breaking Changes\r\n\r\n* TF Core:\r\n  * Certain float32 ops run in lower precsion on Ampere based GPUs, including  matmuls and convolutions, due to the use of [TensorFloat-32](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2020/05/14/tensorfloat-32-precision-format/). Specifically, inputs to such ops are rounded from 23 bits of precision to 10\r\n  bits of precision. This is unlikely to cause issues in practice for deep learning models. In some cases, TensorFloat-32 is also used for complex64 ops.\r\n  TensorFloat-32 can be disabled by running `tf.config.experimental.enable_tensor_float_32_execution(False)`. \r\n  * The byte layout for string tensors across the C-API has been updated to match TF Core/C++; i.e., a contiguous array of `tensorflow::tstring`/`TF_TString`s.\r\n  * C-API functions `TF_StringDecode`, `TF_StringEncode`, and `TF_StringEncodedSize` are no longer relevant and have been removed; see `core/platform/ctstring.h` for  string access/modification in C.\r\n  * `tensorflow.python`, `tensorflow.core` and `tensorflow.compiler` modules are now hidden. These modules are not part of TensorFlow public API.\r\n  * `tf.raw_ops.Max` and `tf.raw_ops.Min` no longer accept inputs of type `tf.complex64` or `tf.complex128`, because the behavior of these ops is not well           defined for complex types.\r\n  * XLA:CPU and XLA:GPU devices are no longer registered by default. Use `TF_XLA_FLAGS=--tf_xla_enable_xla_devices` if you really need them, but this flag will eventually be removed in subsequent releases.\r\n\r\n* `tf.keras`:  \r\n  * The `steps_per_execution` argument in `compile()` is no longer experimental; if you were passing `experimental_steps_per_execution`, rename it to         `steps_per_execution` in your code. This argument controls the number of batches to run during each `tf.function` call when calling `fit()`. Running multiple   batches inside a single `tf.function` call can greatly improve performance on TPUs or small models with a large Python overhead.\r\n  * A **major refactoring** of the internals of the Keras Functional API may affect code that\r\n  is relying on certain internal details:\r\n    * Code that uses `isinstance(x, tf.Tensor)` instead of `tf.is_tensor` when checking Keras symbolic inputs/outputs should switch to using `tf.is_tensor`.\r\n    * Code that is overly dependent on the exact names attached to symbolic tensors (e.g. assumes there will be \":0\" at the end of the inputs, treats names as         unique identifiers instead of using `tensor.ref()`, etc.)\r\n    * Code that uses `get_concrete_function` to trace Keras symbolic inputs directly should switch to building matching `tf.TensorSpec`s directly and tracing the       `TensorSpec` objects.\r\n    * Code that relies on the exact number and names of the op layers that TensorFlow operations  were converted into may have changed.\r\n    * Code that uses `tf.map_fn`/`tf.cond`/`tf.while_loop`/control flow as op layers and  happens to work before TF 2.4. These will explicitly be unsupported           now. Converting these ops to Functional API op layers was unreliable before TF 2.4, and prone to erroring incomprehensibly  or being silently buggy.\r\n    * Code that directly asserts on a Keras symbolic value in cases where ops like `tf.rank` used to  return a static or symbolic value depending on if the input       had a fully static shape or not. Now these ops always return symbolic values.\r\n    * Code already susceptible to leaking tensors outside of graphs becomes slightly more likely to do so now.\r\n    * Code that tries directly getting gradients with respect to symbolic Keras inputs/outputs. Use GradientTape on the actual Tensors passed to the already-           constructed model instead.\r\n    * Code that requires very tricky shape manipulation via converted op layers in order to work, where the Keras symbolic shape inference proves insufficient.\r\n    * Code that tries manually walking a `tf.keras.Model` layer by layer and assumes layers only ever have one positional argument. This assumption doesn't hold       true before TF 2.4 either, but is more likely to cause issues now.\r\n    * Code that manually enters `keras.backend.get_graph()` before building a functional model is no longer needed.\r\n    * Start enforcing input shape assumptions when calling Functional API Keras models. This may potentially break some users, in case there is a mismatch             between the shape used when creating `Input` objects in a Functional model, and the shape of the data passed to that model. You can fix this mismatch by         either calling the model with correctly-shaped data, or by relaxing `Input` shape assumptions (note that you can pass shapes with `None` entries for axes\r\n      that are meant to be dynamic). You can also disable the input checking entirely by setting `model.input_spec = None`.\r\n  * Serveral changes have been made to `tf.keras.mixed_precision.experimental`. Note that it is now recommended to use the non-experimental `tf.keras.mixed_precision` API.\r\n    * `AutoCastVariable.dtype` now refers to the actual variable dtype, not the dtype it will be casted to.\r\n    * When mixed precision is enabled, `tf.keras.layers.Embedding` now outputs a float16 or bfloat16 tensor instead of a float32 tensor.\r\n    * The property `tf.keras.mixed_precision.experimental.LossScaleOptimizer.loss_scale` is \r\n      now a tensor, not a `LossScale` object. This means to get a loss scale of a `LossScaleOptimizer` as a tensor, you must now call \r\n     `opt.loss_scale` instead of `opt.loss_scale()`.\r\n    * The property `should_cast_variables` has been removed from `tf.keras.mixed_precision.experimental.Policy`\r\n    * When passing a `tf.mixed_precision.experimental.DynamicLossScale` to\r\n      `tf.keras.mixed_precision.experimental.LossScaleOptimizer`, the `DynamicLossScale`'s multiplier must be 2.\r\n    * When passing a `tf.mixed_precision.experimental.DynamicLossScale` to `tf.keras.mixed_precision.experimental.LossScaleOptimizer`, \r\n     the weights of the `DynanmicLossScale` are copied into the `LossScaleOptimizer` instead of being reused. This means modifying the \r\n      weights of the `DynamicLossScale` will no longer affect the weights of the LossScaleOptimizer, and vice versa.\r\n    * The global policy can no longer be set to a non-floating point policy in `tf.keras.mixed_precision.experimental.set_policy`\r\n    * In `Layer.call`, `AutoCastVariable`s will no longer be casted within `MirroredStrategy.run` or `ReplicaContext.merge_call`. This is \r\n      because a thread local variable is used to determine whether `AutoCastVariable`s are casted, and those two functions run with a \r\n      different thread. Note this only applies if one of these two functions is called within `Layer.call`; if one of those two functions calls `Layer.call`, `AutoCastVariable`s will still be casted.\r\n\r\n* `tf.data`:\r\n  * `tf.data.experimental.service.DispatchServer` now takes a config tuple instead of individual arguments. Usages should be updated to      `tf.data.experimental.service.DispatchServer(dispatcher_config)`.\r\n  * `tf.data.experimental.service.WorkerServer` now takes a config tuple instead of individual arguments. Usages should be updated to  `tf.data.experimental.service.WorkerServer(worker_config)`.\r\n  \r\n* `tf.distribute`:\r\n  * Removes `tf.distribute.Strategy.experimental_make_numpy_dataset`. Please use `tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices` instead.\r\n  * Renames `experimental_hints` in `tf.distribute.StrategyExtended.reduce_to`, `tf.distribute.StrategyExtended.batch_reduce_to`,      `tf.distribute.ReplicaContext.all_reduce` to `options`:\r\n  * Renames `tf.distribute.experimental.CollectiveHints` to `tf.distribute.experimental.CommunicationOptions`.\r\n  * Renames `tf.distribute.experimental.CollectiveCommunication` to `tf.distribute.experimental.CommunicationImplementation`.\r\n  * Renames `tf.distribute.Strategy.experimental_distribute_datasets_from_function` to `distribute_datasets_from_function` as it is no longer experimental. \r\n  * Removes `tf.distribute.Strategy.experimental_run_v2` method, which was deprecated in TF 2.2.\r\n\r\n* `tf.lite`:\r\n  * `tf.quantization.quantize_and_dequantize_v2` has been introduced, which updates the gradient definition for quantization which is outside the range\r\n     to be 0. To simulate the V1 the behavior of `tf.quantization.quantize_and_dequantize(...)` use             `tf.grad_pass_through(tf.quantization.quantize_and_dequantize_v2)(...)`.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Bug Fixes and Other Changes\r\n\r\n### TF Core:\r\n  * Introduces experimental support for a new module named  [`tf.experimental.numpy`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/experimental/numpy), which\r\n    is a NumPy-compatible API for writing TF programs. This module provides class `ndarray`, which mimics the `ndarray` class in NumPy, and wraps an immutable       `tf.Tensor` under the hood. A subset of NumPy functions (e.g. `numpy.add`) are provided. Their inter-operation with TF facilities is seamless in most cases. \r\n    See [tensorflow/python/ops/numpy_ops/README.md](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/python/ops/numpy_ops/README.md)\r\n    for details of what operations are supported and what are the differences from NumPy.\r\n  * `tf.types.experimental.TensorLike` is a new `Union` type that can be used as type annotation for variables representing a Tensor or a value\r\n    that can be converted to Tensor by `tf.convert_to_tensor`.\r\n  * Calling ops with a python constants or numpy values is now consistent with tf.convert_to_tensor behavior. This avoids operations like\r\n    tf.reshape truncating inputs such as from int64 to int32.\r\n  * Adds `tf.sparse.map_values` to apply a function to the `.value`s of `SparseTensor` arguments.\r\n  * The Python bitwise operators for `Tensor` (`__and__`, `__or__`, `__xor__` and `__invert__` now support non-`bool` arguments and apply\r\n    the corresponding bitwise ops. `bool` arguments continue to be supported and dispatch to logical ops. This brings them more in line with \r\n    Python and NumPy behavior.\r\n  * Adds `tf.SparseTensor.with_values`. This returns a new SparseTensor with the same sparsity pattern, but with new provided values. It is\r\n    similar to the `with_values` function of `RaggedTensor`.\r\n  * Adds `StatelessCase` op, and uses it if none of case branches has stateful ops.\r\n  * Adds `tf.config.experimental.get_memory_usage` to return total memory usage of the device.\r\n  * Adds gradients for `RaggedTensorToVariant` and `RaggedTensorFromVariant`.\r\n  * Improve shape inference of nested function calls by supporting constant folding across Arg nodes which makes more static values available to shape               inference functions.\r\n* `tf.debugging`:\r\n  * `tf.debugging.assert_shapes()` now works on `SparseTensor`s (Fixes [#36268](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/36268)).\r\n* GPU\r\n  * Adds Support for [TensorFloat-32](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2020/05/14/tensorfloat-32-precision-format/) on Ampere based GPUs. \r\n    TensorFloat-32, or TF32 for short, is a math mode for NVIDIA Ampere based GPUs which causes certain float32 ops, such as matrix \r\n    multiplications and convolutions, to run much faster on Ampere GPUs but with reduced precision. This reduced precision has not been found \r\n    to effect convergence quality of deep learning models in practice. TensorFloat-32 is enabled by default, but can be disabled with                 `tf.config.experimental.enable_tensor_float_32_execution`.\r\n* `tf.math`:\r\n  * Adds `tf.math.erfcinv`, the inverse to `tf.math.erfc`.\r\n* `tf.nn`:\r\n  *   `tf.nn.max_pool2d` now supports explicit padding.\r\n* `tf.image`:\r\n  * Adds deterministic `tf.image.stateless_random_*` functions for each `tf.image.random_*` function. Added a new op `stateless_sample_distorted_bounding_box`       which is a deterministic version of `sample_distorted_bounding_box` op. Given the same seed, these stateless functions/ops produce the same results               independent of how many times the function is called, and independent of global seed settings.\r\n  * Adds deterministic `tf.image.resize` backprop CUDA kernels for `method=ResizeMethod.BILINEAR` (the default method). Enable by setting the environment             variable `TF_DETERMINISTIC_OPS` to `\"true\"` or `\"1\"`.\r\n* `tf.print`:\r\n  * Bug fix in `tf.print()` with `OrderedDict` where if an `OrderedDict` didn't have the keys sorted, the keys and values were not being printed\r\n    in accordance with their correct mapping.\r\n* `tf.train.Checkpoint`:\r\n  * Now accepts a `root` argument in the initialization, which generates a checkpoint with a root object. This allows users to create a `Checkpoint` object that     is compatible with Keras `model.save_weights()` and `model.load_weights`. The checkpoint is also compatible with the checkpoint saved in the `variables/`         folder in the SavedModel.\r\n  * When restoring, `save_path` can be a path to a SavedModel. The function will automatically find the checkpoint in the SavedModel.\r\n  \r\n### `tf.data`:\r\n  * Adds new `tf.data.experimental.service.register_dataset` and `tf.data.experimental.service.from_dataset_id` APIs to enable one\r\n    process to register a dataset with the tf.data service, and another process to consume data from the dataset.\r\n  * Adds support for dispatcher fault tolerance. To enable fault tolerance, configure a `work_dir` when running your dispatcher server and set\r\n    `dispatcher_fault_tolerance=True`. The dispatcher will store its state to `work_dir`, so that on restart it can continue from its previous\r\n    state after restart.\r\n  * Adds support for sharing dataset graphs via shared filesystem instead of over RPC. This reduces load on the dispatcher, improving performance\r\n    of distributing datasets. For this to work, the dispatcher's `work_dir` must be accessible from workers. If the worker fails to read from the\r\n    `work_dir`, it falls back to using RPC for dataset graph transfer.\r\n  * Adds support for a new \"distributed_epoch\" processing mode. This processing mode distributes a dataset across all tf.data workers,\r\n    instead of having each worker process the full dataset. See [the tf.data service docs](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/data/experimental/service#understand_processing_mode) to learn more.\r\n  * Adds optional `exclude_cols` parameter to CsvDataset. This parameter is the complement of `select_cols`; at most one of these should be specified.\r\n  * We have implemented an optimization which reorders data-discarding transformations such as `take` and `shard` to happen earlier in the dataset when it is           safe to do so. The optimization can be disabled via the `experimental_optimization.reorder_data_discarding_ops` dataset option.\r\n  * `tf.data.Options` were previously immutable and can now be overridden.\r\n  * `tf.data.Dataset.from_generator` now supports Ragged and Sparse tensors with a new `output_signature` argument, which allows `from_generator` to\r\n    produce any type describable by a `tf.TypeSpec`.\r\n  * `tf.data.experimental.AUTOTUNE` is now available in the core API as `tf.data.AUTOTUNE`.\r\n\r\n### `tf.distribute`:\r\n  * Introduces experimental support for asynchronous training of Keras models via `tf.distribute.experimental.ParameterServerStrategy`:\r\n    * Replaces the existing `tf.distribute.experimental.ParameterServerStrategy` symbol with a new class that is for parameter server training in TF2. Usage of\r\n      the old symbol, usually with Estimator API, should be **replaced** with [`tf.compat.v1.distribute.experimental.ParameterServerStrategy`].\r\n    * Added `tf.distribute.experimental.coordinator.*` namespace, including the main API `ClusterCoordinator` for coordinating the training cluster, the related       data structure `RemoteValue` and `PerWorkerValue`.\r\n  * Adds `tf.distribute.Strategy.gather` and `tf.distribute.ReplicaContext.all_gather` APIs to support gathering dense distributed values.\r\n  * Fixes various issues with saving a distributed model.\r\n\r\n### `tf.keras`:\r\n  * Improvements from the Functional API refactoring:\r\n    * Functional model construction does not need to maintain a global workspace graph, removing memory leaks especially when building many\r\n      models or very large models.\r\n    * Functional model construction should be ~8-10% faster on average.\r\n    * Functional models can now contain non-symbolic values in their call inputs inside of the first positional argument.\r\n    * Several classes of TF ops that were not reliably converted to Keras layers during functional API construction should now work, e.g.\r\n      `tf.image.ssim_multiscale`\r\n    * Error messages when Functional API construction goes wrong (and when ops cannot be converted to Keras layers automatically) should be\r\n      clearer and easier to understand.\r\n  * `Optimizer.minimize` can now accept a loss `Tensor` and a `GradientTape` as an alternative to accepting a `callable` loss.\r\n  * Adds `beta` hyperparameter to FTRL optimizer classes (Keras and others) to match [FTRL paper](https://research.google.com/pubs/archive/41159.pdf).  \r\n  * `Optimizer.__init__` now accepts a `gradient_aggregator` to allow for customization of how gradients are aggregated across devices, as well as\r\n     `gradients_transformers` to allow for custom gradient transformations (such as gradient clipping).\r\n  * Improvements to Keras preprocessing layers:\r\n    * TextVectorization can now accept a vocabulary list or file as an init arg.\r\n    * Normalization can now accept mean and variance values as init args.\r\n  * In `Attention` and `AdditiveAttention` layers, the `call()` method now accepts a `return_attention_scores` argument. When set to\r\n    True, the layer returns the attention scores as an additional output argument.\r\n  * Adds `tf.metrics.log_cosh` and `tf.metrics.logcosh` API entrypoints with the same implementation as their `tf.losses` equivalent.\r\n  * For Keras model, the individual call of `Model.evaluate` uses no cached data for evaluation, while `Model.fit` uses cached data when\r\n    `validation_data` arg is provided for better performance.\r\n  * Adds a `save_traces` argument to `model.save`/ `tf.keras.models.save_model` which determines whether the SavedModel format stores the Keras model/layer call     functions. The traced functions allow Keras to revive custom models and layers without the original class definition, but if this isn't required the tracing     can be disabled with the added option.\r\n  * The `tf.keras.mixed_precision` API is non non-experimental. The\r\n    non-experimental API differs from the experimental API in several ways.\r\n    * `tf.keras.mixed_precision.Policy` no longer takes in a\r\n      `tf.mixed_precision.experimental.LossScale` in the constructor, and no\r\n      longer has a `LossScale` associated with it. Instead, `Model.compile`\r\n      will automatically wrap the optimizer with a `LossScaleOptimizer` using\r\n      dynamic loss scaling if `Policy.name` is \"mixed_float16\".\r\n    * `tf.keras.mixed_precision.LossScaleOptimizer`'s constructor takes in\r\n      different arguments. In particular, it no longer takes in a `LossScale`,\r\n      and there is no longer a `LossScale` associated with the\r\n      `LossScaleOptimizer`. Instead, `LossScaleOptimizer` directly implements\r\n      fixed or dynamic loss scaling. See the documentation of\r\n      [`tf.keras.mixed_precision.experimental.LossScaleOptimizer`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/mixed_precision/experimental/LossScaleOptimizer?version=nightly)\r\n      for details on the differences between the experimental\r\n      `LossScaleOptimizer` and the new non-experimental `LossScaleOptimizer`.\r\n    * `tf.mixed_precision.experimental.LossScale` and its subclasses are\r\n      deprecated, as all of its functionality now exists within\r\n      `tf.keras.mixed_precision.LossScaleOptimizer`\r\n\r\n### `tf.lite`:\r\n  * `TFLiteConverter`:\r\n    * Support optional flags `inference_input_type` and `inference_output_type` for full integer quantized models. This allows users to modify the model input         and output type to integer types (`tf.int8`, `tf.uint8`) instead of defaulting to float type (`tf.float32`). \r\n  * NNAPI\r\n    * Adds NNAPI Delegation support for requantization use cases by converting the operation into a dequantize-quantize pair.\r\n    * Removes deprecated `Interpreter.setUseNNAPI(boolean)` Java API. Use `Interpreter.Options.setUseNNAPI` instead.\r\n    * Deprecates `Interpreter::UseNNAPI(bool)` C++ API. Use `NnApiDelegate()` and related delegate configuration methods directly.\r\n    * Deprecates `Interpreter::SetAllowFp16PrecisionForFp32(bool)` C++ API. Prefer controlling this via delegate options, e.g. `tflite::StatefulNnApiDelegate::Options::allow_fp16' or `TfLiteGpuDelegateOptionsV2::is_precision_loss_allowed`.\r\n  * GPU\r\n    * GPU acceleration now supports quantized models by default\r\n  * `DynamicBuffer::AddJoinedString()` will now add a separator if the first string to be joined is empty.\r\n  *  Adds support for cumulative sum (cumsum), both as builtin op and MLIR conversion.\r\n  \r\n### `TensorRT`\r\n  * Issues a warning when the `session_config` parameter for the TF1 converter is used or the `rewrite_config_template` field in the TF2\r\n    converter parameter object is used.\r\n    \r\n### TPU Enhancements:\r\n  * Adds support for the `beta` parameter of the FTRL optimizer for TPU embeddings. Users of other TensorFlow platforms can implement equivalent\r\n    behavior by adjusting the `l2` parameter.\r\n\r\n### XLA Support:\r\n  * xla.experimental.compile is deprecated, use `tf.function(experimental_compile=True)` instead. \r\n  * Adds `tf.function.experimental_get_compiler_ir` which returns compiler IR (currently 'hlo' and 'optimized_hlo') for given input for given function.\r\n  \r\n### Security:\r\n  * Fixes an undefined behavior causing a segfault in `tf.raw_ops.Switch`, ([CVE-2020-15190](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-15190))\r\n  * Fixes three vulnerabilities in conversion to DLPack format\r\n    * [CVE-2020-15191](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-15191),\r\n    * [CVE-2020-15192](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-15192),\r\n    * [CVE-2020-15193](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-15193)\r\n  * Fixes two vulnerabilities in `SparseFillEmptyRowsGrad`\r\n    * [CVE-2020-15194](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-15194),\r\n    * [CVE-2020-15195](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-15195)\r\n  * Fixes several vulnerabilities in `RaggedCountSparseOutput` and `SparseCountSparseOutput` operations\r\n    * [CVE-2020-15196](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-15196),\r\n    * [CVE-2020-15197](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-15197),\r\n    * [CVE-2020-15198](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-15198),\r\n    * [CVE-2020-15199](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-15199),\r\n    * [CVE-2020-15200](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-15200),\r\n    * [CVE-2020-15201](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-15201)\r\n  * Fixes an integer truncation vulnerability in code using the work sharder API, ([CVE-2020-15202](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-15202))\r\n  * Fixes a format string vulnerability in `tf.strings.as_string`, ([CVE-2020-15203](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-15203))\r\n  * Fixes segfault raised by calling session-only ops in eager mode, ([CVE-2020-15204](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-15204))\r\n  * Fixes data leak and potential ASLR violation from `tf.raw_ops.StringNGrams`, ([CVE-2020-15205](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-15205))\r\n  * Fixes segfaults caused by incomplete `SavedModel` validation, ([CVE-2020-15206](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-15206))\r\n  * Fixes a data corruption due to a bug in negative indexing support in TFLite, ([CVE-2020-15207](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-15207))\r\n  * Fixes a data corruption due to dimension mismatch in TFLite, ([CVE-2020-15208](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-15208))\r\n  * Fixes several vulnerabilities in TFLite saved model format\r\n    * [CVE-2020-15209](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-15209),\r\n    * [CVE-2020-15210](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-15210),\r\n    * [CVE-2020-15211](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-15211)\r\n  * Fixes several vulnerabilities in TFLite implementation of segment sum\r\n    * [CVE-2020-15212](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-15212),\r\n    * [CVE-2020-15213](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-15213),\r\n    * [CVE-2020-15214](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-15214)\r\n  * Fixes a segfault in `tf.quantization.quantize_and_dequantize`, ([CVE-2020-15265](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-15265))\r\n  * Fixes an undefined behavior float cast causing a crash, ([CVE-2020-15266](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-15266))\r\n    \r\n### Other:\r\n  * We have replaced uses of \"whitelist\" and \"blacklist\" with \"allowlist\" and \"denylist\" where possible.

    "body": "# Release 2.4.0\r\n\r\n## Major Features and Improvements\r\n\r\n* `tf.distribute` introduces experimental support for asynchronous training of Keras models via the [`tf.distribute.experimental.ParameterServerStrategy`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/distribute/experimental/ParameterServerStrategy?version=nightly) API. Please see below for additional details.\r\n\r\n* [`MultiWorkerMirroredStrategy`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/distribute/MultiWorkerMirroredStrategy) is now a stable API and is no longer considered experimental. Some of the major improvements involve handling peer failure and many bug fixes. Please check out the detailed tutorial on [Multi-worker training with Keras](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/distribute/multi_worker_with_keras). \r\n\r\n* Introduces experimental support for a new module named [`tf.experimental.numpy`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/experimental/numpy) which is a NumPy-compatible API for writing TF programs. See the [detailed guide](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/tf_numpy) to learn more. Additional details below. \r\n\r\n* Adds Support for\r\n  [TensorFloat-32](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2020/05/14/tensorfloat-32-precision-format/) on Ampere based GPUs. TensorFloat-32, or TF32 for short, is a math mode for NVIDIA Ampere based GPUs and is enabled by default. \r\n  \r\n* A major refactoring of the internals of the Keras Functional API has been completed, that should improve the reliability, stability, and performance of constructing Functional models.\r\n\r\n* Keras mixed precision API [`tf.keras.mixed_precision`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/mixed_precision?version=nightly) is no longer experimental and allows the use of 16-bit floating point formats during training, improving performance by up to 3x on GPUs and 60% on TPUs. Please see below for additional details.\r\n\r\n* TF Profiler now supports profiling multiple workers using the [sampling mode API](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/profiler#profiling_apis).\r\n\r\n* TFLite Profiler for Android is available. See the detailed [guide](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/performance/measurement#trace_tensorflow_lite_internals_in_android) to learn more.\r\n\r\n* TensorFlow pip packages are now built with CUDA11 and cuDNN 8.0.2.\r\n\r\n## Breaking Changes\r\n\r\n* TF Core:\r\n  * Certain float32 ops run in lower precsion on Ampere based GPUs, including  matmuls and convolutions, due to the use of [TensorFloat-32](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2020/05/14/tensorfloat-32-precision-format/). Specifically, inputs to such ops are rounded from 23 bits of precision to 10\r\n  bits of precision. This is unlikely to cause issues in practice for deep learning models. In some cases, TensorFloat-32 is also used for complex64 ops.\r\n  TensorFloat-32 can be disabled by running `tf.config.experimental.enable_tensor_float_32_execution(False)`. \r\n  * The byte layout for string tensors across the C-API has been updated to match TF Core/C++; i.e., a contiguous array of `tensorflow::tstring`/`TF_TString`s.\r\n  * C-API functions `TF_StringDecode`, `TF_StringEncode`, and `TF_StringEncodedSize` are no longer relevant and have been removed; see `core/platform/ctstring.h` for  string access/modification in C.\r\n  * `tensorflow.python`, `tensorflow.core` and `tensorflow.compiler` modules are now hidden. These modules are not part of TensorFlow public API.\r\n  * `tf.raw_ops.Max` and `tf.raw_ops.Min` no longer accept inputs of type `tf.complex64` or `tf.complex128`, because the behavior of these ops is not well           defined for complex types.\r\n  * XLA:CPU and XLA:GPU devices are no longer registered by default. Use `TF_XLA_FLAGS=--tf_xla_enable_xla_devices` if you really need them, but this flag will eventually be removed in subsequent releases.\r\n\r\n* `tf.keras`:  \r\n  * The `steps_per_execution` argument in `compile()` is no longer experimental; if you were passing `experimental_steps_per_execution`, rename it to         `steps_per_execution` in your code. This argument controls the number of batches to run during each `tf.function` call when calling `fit()`. Running multiple   batches inside a single `tf.function` call can greatly improve performance on TPUs or small models with a large Python overhead.\r\n  * A **major refactoring** of the internals of the Keras Functional API may affect code that\r\n  is relying on certain internal details:\r\n    * Code that uses `isinstance(x, tf.Tensor)` instead of `tf.is_tensor` when checking Keras symbolic inputs/outputs should switch to using `tf.is_tensor`.\r\n    * Code that is overly dependent on the exact names attached to symbolic tensors (e.g. assumes there will be \":0\" at the end of the inputs, treats names as         unique identifiers instead of using `tensor.ref()`, etc.)\r\n    * Code that uses `get_concrete_function` to trace Keras symbolic inputs directly should switch to building matching `tf.TensorSpec`s directly and tracing the       `TensorSpec` objects.\r\n    * Code that relies on the exact number and names of the op layers that TensorFlow operations  were converted into may have changed.\r\n    * Code that uses `tf.map_fn`/`tf.cond`/`tf.while_loop`/control flow as op layers and  happens to work before TF 2.4. These will explicitly be unsupported           now. Converting these ops to Functional API op layers was unreliable before TF 2.4, and prone to erroring incomprehensibly  or being silently buggy.\r\n    * Code that directly asserts on a Keras symbolic value in cases where ops like `tf.rank` used to  return a static or symbolic value depending on if the input       had a fully static shape or not. Now these ops always return symbolic values.\r\n    * Code already susceptible to leaking tensors outside of graphs becomes slightly more likely to do so now.\r\n    * Code that tries directly getting gradients with respect to symbolic Keras inputs/outputs. Use GradientTape on the actual Tensors passed to the already-           constructed model instead.\r\n    * Code that requires very tricky shape manipulation via converted op layers in order to work, where the Keras symbolic shape inference proves insufficient.\r\n    * Code that tries manually walking a `tf.keras.Model` layer by layer and assumes layers only ever have one positional argument. This assumption doesn't hold       true before TF 2.4 either, but is more likely to cause issues now.\r\n    * Code that manually enters `keras.backend.get_graph()` before building a functional model is no longer needed.\r\n    * Start enforcing input shape assumptions when calling Functional API Keras models. This may potentially break some users, in case there is a mismatch             between the shape used when creating `Input` objects in a Functional model, and the shape of the data passed to that model. You can fix this mismatch by         either calling the model with correctly-shaped data, or by relaxing `Input` shape assumptions (note that you can pass shapes with `None` entries for axes\r\n      that are meant to be dynamic). You can also disable the input checking entirely by setting `model.input_spec = None`.\r\n  * Serveral changes have been made to `tf.keras.mixed_precision.experimental`. Note that it is now recommended to use the non-experimental `tf.keras.mixed_precision` API.\r\n    * `AutoCastVariable.dtype` now refers to the actual variable dtype, not the\r\n       dtype it will be casted to.\r\n    * When mixed precision is enabled, `tf.keras.layers.Embedding` now outputs a\r\n      float16 or bfloat16 tensor instead of a float32 tensor.\r\n    * The property\r\n      `tf.keras.mixed_precision.experimental.LossScaleOptimizer.loss_scale` is \r\n      now a tensor, not a `LossScale` object. This means to get a loss scale of\r\n      a `LossScaleOptimizer` as a tensor, you must now call `opt.loss_scale`\r\n      instead of `opt.loss_scale()`.\r\n    * The property `should_cast_variables` has been removed from\r\n      `tf.keras.mixed_precision.experimental.Policy`\r\n    * When passing a `tf.mixed_precision.experimental.DynamicLossScale` to\r\n      `tf.keras.mixed_precision.experimental.LossScaleOptimizer`, the\r\n      `DynamicLossScale`'s multiplier must be 2.\r\n    * When passing a `tf.mixed_precision.experimental.DynamicLossScale` to\r\n      `tf.keras.mixed_precision.experimental.LossScaleOptimizer`, the weights of\r\n      the `DynanmicLossScale` are copied into the `LossScaleOptimizer` instead\r\n      of being reused. This means modifying the weights of the\r\n      `DynamicLossScale` will no longer affect the weights of the\r\n      LossScaleOptimizer, and vice versa.\r\n    * The global policy can no longer be set to a non-floating point policy in\r\n      `tf.keras.mixed_precision.experimental.set_policy`\r\n    * In `Layer.call`, `AutoCastVariable`s will no longer be casted within\r\n      `MirroredStrategy.run` or `ReplicaContext.merge_call`. This is because a\r\n      thread local variable is used to determine whether `AutoCastVariable`s are\r\n      casted, and those two functions run with a different thread. Note this\r\n      only applies if one of these two functions is called within `Layer.call`;\r\n      if one of those two functions calls `Layer.call`, `AutoCastVariable`s will\r\n      still be casted.\r\n\r\n* `tf.data`:\r\n  * `tf.data.experimental.service.DispatchServer` now takes a config tuple instead of individual arguments. Usages should be updated to      `tf.data.experimental.service.DispatchServer(dispatcher_config)`.\r\n  * `tf.data.experimental.service.WorkerServer` now takes a config tuple instead of individual arguments. Usages should be updated to  `tf.data.experimental.service.WorkerServer(worker_config)`.\r\n  \r\n* `tf.distribute`:\r\n  * Removes `tf.distribute.Strategy.experimental_make_numpy_dataset`. Please use `tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices` instead.\r\n  * Renames `experimental_hints` in `tf.distribute.StrategyExtended.reduce_to`, `tf.distribute.StrategyExtended.batch_reduce_to`,      `tf.distribute.ReplicaContext.all_reduce` to `options`:\r\n  * Renames `tf.distribute.experimental.CollectiveHints` to `tf.distribute.experimental.CommunicationOptions`.\r\n  * Renames `tf.distribute.experimental.CollectiveCommunication` to `tf.distribute.experimental.CommunicationImplementation`.\r\n  * Renames `tf.distribute.Strategy.experimental_distribute_datasets_from_function` to `distribute_datasets_from_function` as it is no longer experimental. \r\n  * Removes `tf.distribute.Strategy.experimental_run_v2` method, which was deprecated in TF 2.2.\r\n\r\n* `tf.lite`:\r\n  * `tf.quantization.quantize_and_dequantize_v2` has been introduced, which updates the gradient definition for quantization which is outside the range\r\n     to be 0. To simulate the V1 the behavior of `tf.quantization.quantize_and_dequantize(...)` use             `tf.grad_pass_through(tf.quantization.quantize_and_dequantize_v2)(...)`.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Bug Fixes and Other Changes\r\n\r\n### TF Core:\r\n  * Introduces experimental support for a new module named  [`tf.experimental.numpy`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/experimental/numpy), which\r\n    is a NumPy-compatible API for writing TF programs. This module provides class `ndarray`, which mimics the `ndarray` class in NumPy, and wraps an immutable       `tf.Tensor` under the hood. A subset of NumPy functions (e.g. `numpy.add`) are provided. Their inter-operation with TF facilities is seamless in most cases. \r\n    See [tensorflow/python/ops/numpy_ops/README.md](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/python/ops/numpy_ops/README.md)\r\n    for details of what operations are supported and what are the differences from NumPy.\r\n  * `tf.types.experimental.TensorLike` is a new `Union` type that can be used as type annotation for variables representing a Tensor or a value\r\n    that can be converted to Tensor by `tf.convert_to_tensor`.\r\n  * Calling ops with a python constants or numpy values is now consistent with tf.convert_to_tensor behavior. This avoids operations like\r\n    tf.reshape truncating inputs such as from int64 to int32.\r\n  * Adds `tf.sparse.map_values` to apply a function to the `.value`s of `SparseTensor` arguments.\r\n  * The Python bitwise operators for `Tensor` (`__and__`, `__or__`, `__xor__` and `__invert__` now support non-`bool` arguments and apply\r\n    the corresponding bitwise ops. `bool` arguments continue to be supported and dispatch to logical ops. This brings them more in line with \r\n    Python and NumPy behavior.\r\n  * Adds `tf.SparseTensor.with_values`. This returns a new SparseTensor with the same sparsity pattern, but with new provided values. It is\r\n    similar to the `with_values` function of `RaggedTensor`.\r\n  * Adds `StatelessCase` op, and uses it if none of case branches has stateful ops.\r\n  * Adds `tf.config.experimental.get_memory_usage` to return total memory usage of the device.\r\n  * Adds gradients for `RaggedTensorToVariant` and `RaggedTensorFromVariant`.\r\n  * Improve shape inference of nested function calls by supporting constant folding across Arg nodes which makes more static values available to shape               inference functions.\r\n* `tf.debugging`:\r\n  * `tf.debugging.assert_shapes()` now works on `SparseTensor`s (Fixes [#36268](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/36268)).\r\n* GPU\r\n  * Adds Support for [TensorFloat-32](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2020/05/14/tensorfloat-32-precision-format/) on Ampere based GPUs. \r\n    TensorFloat-32, or TF32 for short, is a math mode for NVIDIA Ampere based GPUs which causes certain float32 ops, such as matrix \r\n    multiplications and convolutions, to run much faster on Ampere GPUs but with reduced precision. This reduced precision has not been found \r\n    to effect convergence quality of deep learning models in practice. TensorFloat-32 is enabled by default, but can be disabled with                 `tf.config.experimental.enable_tensor_float_32_execution`.\r\n* `tf.math`:\r\n  * Adds `tf.math.erfcinv`, the inverse to `tf.math.erfc`.\r\n* `tf.nn`:\r\n  *   `tf.nn.max_pool2d` now supports explicit padding.\r\n* `tf.image`:\r\n  * Adds deterministic `tf.image.stateless_random_*` functions for each `tf.image.random_*` function. Added a new op `stateless_sample_distorted_bounding_box`       which is a deterministic version of `sample_distorted_bounding_box` op. Given the same seed, these stateless functions/ops produce the same results               independent of how many times the function is called, and independent of global seed settings.\r\n* `tf.print`:\r\n  * Bug fix in `tf.print()` with `OrderedDict` where if an `OrderedDict` didn't have the keys sorted, the keys and values were not being printed\r\n    in accordance with their correct mapping.\r\n* `tf.train.Checkpoint`:\r\n  * Now accepts a `root` argument in the initialization, which generates a checkpoint with a root object. This allows users to create a `Checkpoint` object that     is compatible with Keras `model.save_weights()` and `model.load_weights`. The checkpoint is also compatible with the checkpoint saved in the `variables/`         folder in the SavedModel.\r\n  * When restoring, `save_path` can be a path to a SavedModel. The function will automatically find the checkpoint in the SavedModel.\r\n  \r\n### `tf.data`:\r\n  * Adds new `tf.data.experimental.service.register_dataset` and `tf.data.experimental.service.from_dataset_id` APIs to enable one\r\n    process to register a dataset with the tf.data service, and another process to consume data from the dataset.\r\n  * Adds support for dispatcher fault tolerance. To enable fault tolerance, configure a `work_dir` when running your dispatcher server and set\r\n    `dispatcher_fault_tolerance=True`. The dispatcher will store its state to `work_dir`, so that on restart it can continue from its previous\r\n    state after restart.\r\n  * Adds support for sharing dataset graphs via shared filesystem instead of over RPC. This reduces load on the dispatcher, improving performance\r\n    of distributing datasets. For this to work, the dispatcher's `work_dir` must be accessible from workers. If the worker fails to read from the\r\n    `work_dir`, it falls back to using RPC for dataset graph transfer.\r\n  * Adds support for a new \"distributed_epoch\" processing mode. This processing mode distributes a dataset across all tf.data workers,\r\n    instead of having each worker process the full dataset. See [the tf.data service docs](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/data/experimental/service#understand_processing_mode) to learn more.\r\n  * Adds optional `exclude_cols` parameter to CsvDataset. This parameter is the complement of `select_cols`; at most one of these should be specified.\r\n  * We have implemented an optimization which reorders data-discarding transformations such as `take` and `shard` to happen earlier in the dataset when it is           safe to do so. The optimization can be disabled via the `experimental_optimization.reorder_data_discarding_ops` dataset option.\r\n  * `tf.data.Options` were previously immutable and can now be overridden.\r\n  * `tf.data.Dataset.from_generator` now supports Ragged and Sparse tensors with a new `output_signature` argument, which allows `from_generator` to\r\n    produce any type describable by a `tf.TypeSpec`.\r\n  * `tf.data.experimental.AUTOTUNE` is now available in the core API as `tf.data.AUTOTUNE`.\r\n\r\n### `tf.distribute`:\r\n  * Introduces experimental support for asynchronous training of Keras models via `tf.distribute.experimental.ParameterServerStrategy`:\r\n    * Replaces the existing `tf.distribute.experimental.ParameterServerStrategy` symbol with a new class that is for parameter server training in TF2. Usage of\r\n      the old symbol, usually with Estimator API, should be **replaced** with [`tf.compat.v1.distribute.experimental.ParameterServerStrategy`].\r\n    * Added `tf.distribute.experimental.coordinator.*` namespace, including the main API `ClusterCoordinator` for coordinating the training cluster, the related       data structure `RemoteValue` and `PerWorkerValue`.\r\n  * Adds `tf.distribute.Strategy.gather` and `tf.distribute.ReplicaContext.all_gather` APIs to support gathering dense distributed values.\r\n  * Fixes various issues with saving a distributed model.\r\n\r\n### `tf.keras`:\r\n  * Improvements from the Functional API refactoring:\r\n    * Functional model construction does not need to maintain a global workspace graph, removing memory leaks especially when building many\r\n      models or very large models.\r\n    * Functional model construction should be ~8-10% faster on average.\r\n    * Functional models can now contain non-symbolic values in their call inputs inside of the first positional argument.\r\n    * Several classes of TF ops that were not reliably converted to Keras layers during functional API construction should now work, e.g.\r\n      `tf.image.ssim_multiscale`\r\n    * Error messages when Functional API construction goes wrong (and when ops cannot be converted to Keras layers automatically) should be\r\n      clearer and easier to understand.\r\n  * `Optimizer.minimize` can now accept a loss `Tensor` and a `GradientTape` as an alternative to accepting a `callable` loss.\r\n  * Adds `beta` hyperparameter to FTRL optimizer classes (Keras and others) to match [FTRL paper](https://research.google.com/pubs/archive/41159.pdf).  \r\n  * `Optimizer.__init__` now accepts a `gradient_aggregator` to allow for customization of how gradients are aggregated across devices, as well as\r\n     `gradients_transformers` to allow for custom gradient transformations (such as gradient clipping).\r\n  * Improvements to Keras preprocessing layers:\r\n    * TextVectorization can now accept a vocabulary list or file as an init arg.\r\n    * Normalization can now accept mean and variance values as init args.\r\n  * In `Attention` and `AdditiveAttention` layers, the `call()` method now accepts a `return_attention_scores` argument. When set to\r\n    True, the layer returns the attention scores as an additional output argument.\r\n  * Adds `tf.metrics.log_cosh` and `tf.metrics.logcosh` API entrypoints with the same implementation as their `tf.losses` equivalent.\r\n  * For Keras model, the individual call of `Model.evaluate` uses no cached data for evaluation, while `Model.fit` uses cached data when\r\n    `validation_data` arg is provided for better performance.\r\n  * Adds a `save_traces` argument to `model.save`/ `tf.keras.models.save_model` which determines whether the SavedModel format stores the Keras model/layer call     functions. The traced functions allow Keras to revive custom models and layers without the original class definition, but if this isn't required the tracing     can be disabled with the added option.\r\n  * The `tf.keras.mixed_precision` API is non non-experimental. The\r\n    non-experimental API differs from the experimental API in several ways.\r\n    * `tf.keras.mixed_precision.Policy` no longer takes in a\r\n      `tf.mixed_precision.experimental.LossScale` in the constructor, and no\r\n      longer has a `LossScale` associated with it. Instead, `Model.compile`\r\n      will automatically wrap the optimizer with a `LossScaleOptimizer` using\r\n      dynamic loss scaling if `Policy.name` is \"mixed_float16\".\r\n    * `tf.keras.mixed_precision.LossScaleOptimizer`'s constructor takes in\r\n      different arguments. In particular, it no longer takes in a `LossScale`,\r\n      and there is no longer a `LossScale` associated with the\r\n      `LossScaleOptimizer`. Instead, `LossScaleOptimizer` directly implements\r\n      fixed or dynamic loss scaling. See the documentation of\r\n      [`tf.keras.mixed_precision.experimental.LossScaleOptimizer`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/mixed_precision/experimental/LossScaleOptimizer?version=nightly)\r\n      for details on the differences between the experimental\r\n      `LossScaleOptimizer` and the new non-experimental `LossScaleOptimizer`.\r\n    * `tf.mixed_precision.experimental.LossScale` and its subclasses are\r\n      deprecated, as all of its functionality now exists within\r\n      `tf.keras.mixed_precision.LossScaleOptimizer`\r\n\r\n### `tf.lite`:\r\n  * `TFLiteConverter`:\r\n    * Support optional flags `inference_input_type` and `inference_output_type` for full integer quantized models. This allows users to modify the model input         and output type to integer types (`tf.int8`, `tf.uint8`) instead of defaulting to float type (`tf.float32`). \r\n  * NNAPI\r\n    * Adds NNAPI Delegation support for requantization use cases by converting the operation into a dequantize-quantize pair.\r\n    * Removes deprecated `Interpreter.setUseNNAPI(boolean)` Java API. Use `Interpreter.Options.setUseNNAPI` instead.\r\n    * Deprecates `Interpreter::UseNNAPI(bool)` C++ API.

    "body": "# Release 2.4.0\r\n\r\n## Major Features and Improvements\r\n\r\n* `tf.distribute` introduces experimental support for asynchronous training of Keras models via the [`tf.distribute.experimental.ParameterServerStrategy`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/distribute/experimental/ParameterServerStrategy?version=nightly) API. Please see below for additional details.\r\n\r\n* [`MultiWorkerMirroredStrategy`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/distribute/MultiWorkerMirroredStrategy) is now a stable API and is no longer considered experimental. Some of the major improvements involve handling peer failure and many bug fixes. Please check out the detailed tutorial on [Multi-worker training with Keras](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/distribute/multi_worker_with_keras). \r\n\r\n* Introduces experimental support for a new module named [`tf.experimental.numpy`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/experimental/numpy) which is a NumPy-compatible API for writing TF programs. See the [detailed guide](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/tf_numpy) to learn more. Additional details below. \r\n\r\n* Adds Support for [TensorFloat-32](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2020/05/14/tensorfloat-32-precision-format/) on Ampere based GPUs. TensorFloat-32, or TF32 for short, is a math mode for NVIDIA Ampere based GPUs and is enabled by default. \r\n  \r\n* A major refactoring of the internals of the Keras Functional API has been completed, that should improve the reliability, stability, and performance of constructing Functional models.\r\n\r\n* Keras mixed precision API [`tf.keras.mixed_precision`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/mixed_precision?version=nightly) is no longer experimental and allows the use of 16-bit floating point formats during training, improving performance by up to 3x on GPUs and 60% on TPUs.\r\n\r\n* TF Profiler now supports profiling multiple workers using the [sampling mode API](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/profiler#profiling_apis).\r\n\r\n* TFLite Profiler for Android is available. See the detailed [guide](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/performance/measurement#trace_tensorflow_lite_internals_in_android) to learn more.\r\n\r\n* TensorFlow pip packages are now built with CUDA11 and cuDNN 8.0.2.\r\n\r\n## Breaking Changes\r\n\r\n* TF Core:\r\n  * The byte layout for string tensors across the C-API has been updated to match TF Core/C++; i.e., a contiguous array of `tensorflow::tstring`/`TF_TString`s.\r\n  * C-API functions `TF_StringDecode`, `TF_StringEncode`, and `TF_StringEncodedSize` are no longer relevant and have been removed; see `core/platform/ctstring.h` for  string access/modification in C.\r\n  * `tensorflow.python`, `tensorflow.core` and `tensorflow.compiler` modules are now hidden. These modules are not part of TensorFlow public API.\r\n  * `tf.raw_ops.Max` and `tf.raw_ops.Min` no longer accept inputs of type `tf.complex64` or `tf.complex128`, because the behavior of these ops is not well           defined for complex types.\r\n  * Certain float32 ops run in lower precsion on Ampere based GPUs, including  matmuls and convolutions, due to the use of [TensorFloat-32](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2020/05/14/tensorfloat-32-precision-format/). Specifically, inputs to such ops are rounded from 23 bits of precision to 10\r\n  bits of precision. This is unlikely to cause issues in practice for deep learning models. In some cases, TensorFloat-32 is also used for complex64 ops.\r\n  TensorFloat-32 can be disabled by running `config.experimental.enable_tensor_float_32_execution(False)`. \r\n  * XLA:CPU and XLA:GPU devices are no longer registered by default. Use `TF_XLA_FLAGS=--tf_xla_enable_xla_devices` if you really need them, but this flag will eventually be removed in subsequent releases.\r\n\r\n* `tf.keras`:  \r\n  * The `steps_per_execution` argument in `compile()` is no longer experimental; if you were passing `experimental_steps_per_execution`, rename it to         `steps_per_execution` in your code. This argument controls the number of batches to run during each `tf.function` call when calling `fit()`. Running multiple   batches inside a single `tf.function` call can greatly improve performance on TPUs or small models with a large Python overhead.\r\n  * A **major refactoring** of the internals of the Keras Functional API may affect code that\r\n  is relying on certain internal details:\r\n    * Code that uses `isinstance(x, tf.Tensor)` instead of `tf.is_tensor` when checking Keras symbolic inputs/outputs should switch to using `tf.is_tensor`.\r\n    * Code that is overly dependent on the exact names attached to symbolic tensors (e.g. assumes there will be \":0\" at the end of the inputs, treats names as         unique identifiers instead of using `tensor.ref()`, etc.)\r\n    * Code that uses `get_concrete_function` to trace Keras symbolic inputs directly should switch to building matching `tf.TensorSpec`s directly and tracing the       `TensorSpec` objects.\r\n    * Code that relies on the exact number and names of the op layers that TensorFlow operations  were converted into may have changed.\r\n    * Code that uses `tf.map_fn`/`tf.cond`/`tf.while_loop`/control flow as op layers and  happens to work before TF 2.4. These will explicitly be unsupported           now. Converting these ops to Functional API op layers was unreliable before TF 2.4, and prone to erroring incomprehensibly  or being silently buggy.\r\n    * Code that directly asserts on a Keras symbolic value in cases where ops like `tf.rank` used to  return a static or symbolic value depending on if the input       had a fully static shape or not. Now these ops always return symbolic values.\r\n    * Code already susceptible to leaking tensors outside of graphs becomes slightly more likely to do so now.\r\n    * Code that tries directly getting gradients with respect to symbolic Keras inputs/outputs. Use GradientTape on the actual Tensors passed to the already-           constructed model instead.\r\n    * Code that requires very tricky shape manipulation via converted op layers in order to work, where the Keras symbolic shape inference proves insufficient.\r\n    * Code that tries manually walking a `tf.keras.Model` layer by layer and assumes layers only ever have one positional argument. This assumption doesn't hold       true before TF 2.4 either, but is more likely to cause issues now.\r\n    * Code that manually enters `keras.backend.get_graph()` before building a functional model is no longer needed.\r\n    * Start enforcing input shape assumptions when calling Functional API Keras models. This may potentially break some users, in case there is a mismatch             between the shape used when creating `Input` objects in a Functional model, and the shape of the data passed to that model. You can fix this mismatch by         either calling the model with correctly-shaped data, or by relaxing `Input` shape assumptions (note that you can pass shapes with `None` entries for axes\r\n      that are meant to be dynamic). You can also disable the input checking entirely by setting `model.input_spec = None`.\r\n\r\n* `tf.data`:\r\n  * `tf.data.experimental.service.DispatchServer` now takes a config tuple instead of individual arguments. Usages should be updated to      `tf.data.experimental.service.DispatchServer(dispatcher_config)`.\r\n  * `tf.data.experimental.service.WorkerServer` now takes a config tuple instead of individual arguments. Usages should be updated to  `tf.data.experimental.service.WorkerServer(worker_config)`.\r\n  \r\n* `tf.distribute`:\r\n  * Removes `tf.distribute.Strategy.experimental_make_numpy_dataset`. Please use `tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices` instead.\r\n  * Renames `experimental_hints` in `tf.distribute.StrategyExtended.reduce_to`, `tf.distribute.StrategyExtended.batch_reduce_to`,      `tf.distribute.ReplicaContext.all_reduce` to `options`:\r\n  * Renames `tf.distribute.experimental.CollectiveHints` to `tf.distribute.experimental.CommunicationOptions`.\r\n  * Renames `tf.distribute.experimental.CollectiveCommunication` to `tf.distribute.experimental.CommunicationImplementation`.\r\n  * Renames `tf.distribute.Strategy.experimental_distribute_datasets_from_function` to `distribute_datasets_from_function` as it is no longer experimental. \r\n  * Removes `tf.distribute.Strategy.experimental_run_v2` method, which was deprecated in TF 2.2.\r\n\r\n* `tf.lite`:\r\n  * `tf.quantization.quantize_and_dequantize_v2` has been introduced, which updates the gradient definition for quantization which is outside the range\r\n     to be 0. To simulate the V1 the behavior of `tf.quantization.quantize_and_dequantize(...)` use             `tf.grad_pass_through(tf.quantization.quantize_and_dequantize_v2)(...)`.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Bug Fixes and Other Changes\r\n\r\n### TF Core:\r\n  * Introduces experimental support for a new module named  [`tf.experimental.numpy`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/experimental/numpy), which\r\n    is a NumPy-compatible API for writing TF programs. This module provides class `ndarray`, which mimics the `ndarray` class in NumPy, and wraps an immutable       `tf.Tensor` under the hood. A subset of NumPy functions (e.g. `numpy.add`) are provided. Their inter-operation with TF facilities is seamless in most cases. \r\n    See [tensorflow/python/ops/numpy_ops/README.md](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/python/ops/numpy_ops/README.md)\r\n    for details of what operations are supported and what are the differences from NumPy.\r\n  * `tf.types.experimental.TensorLike` is a new `Union` type that can be used as type annotation for variables representing a Tensor or a value\r\n    that can be converted to Tensor by `tf.convert_to_tensor`.\r\n  * Calling ops with a python constants or numpy values is now consistent with tf.convert_to_tensor behavior. This avoids operations like\r\n    tf.reshape truncating inputs such as from int64 to int32.\r\n  * Adds `tf.sparse.map_values` to apply a function to the `.value`s of `SparseTensor` arguments.\r\n  * The Python bitwise operators for `Tensor` (`__and__`, `__or__`, `__xor__` and `__invert__` now support non-`bool` arguments and apply\r\n    the corresponding bitwise ops. `bool` arguments continue to be supported and dispatch to logical ops. This brings them more in line with \r\n    Python and NumPy behavior.\r\n  * Adds `tf.SparseTensor.with_values`. This returns a new SparseTensor with the same sparsity pattern, but with new provided values. It is\r\n    similar to the `with_values` function of `RaggedTensor`.\r\n  * Adds `StatelessCase` op, and uses it if none of case branches has stateful ops.\r\n  * Adds `tf.config.experimental.get_memory_usage` to return total memory usage of the device.\r\n  * Adds gradients for `RaggedTensorToVariant` and `RaggedTensorFromVariant`.\r\n  * Improve shape inference of nested function calls by supporting constant folding across Arg nodes which makes more static values available to shape               inference functions.\r\n* `tf.debugging`:\r\n  * `tf.debugging.assert_shapes()` now works on `SparseTensor`s (Fixes [#36268](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/36268)).\r\n* GPU\r\n  * Adds Support for [TensorFloat-32](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2020/05/14/tensorfloat-32-precision-format/) on Ampere based GPUs. \r\n    TensorFloat-32, or TF32 for short, is a math mode for NVIDIA Ampere based GPUs which causes certain float32 ops, such as matrix \r\n    multiplications and convolutions, to run much faster on Ampere GPUs but with reduced precision. This reduced precision has not been found \r\n    to effect convergence quality of deep learning models in practice. TensorFloat-32 is enabled by default, but can be disabled with                 `tf.config.experimental.enable_tensor_float_32_execution`.\r\n* `tf.math`:\r\n  * Adds `tf.math.erfcinv`, the inverse to `tf.math.erfc`.\r\n* `tf.nn`:\r\n  *   `tf.nn.max_pool2d` now supports explicit padding.\r\n* `tf.image`:\r\n  * Adds deterministic `tf.image.stateless_random_*` functions for each `tf.image.random_*` function. Added a new op `stateless_sample_distorted_bounding_box`       which is a deterministic version of `sample_distorted_bounding_box` op. Given the same seed, these stateless functions/ops produce the same results               independent of how many times the function is called, and independent of global seed settings.\r\n* `tf.print`:\r\n  * Bug fix in `tf.print()` with `OrderedDict` where if an `OrderedDict` didn't have the keys sorted, the keys and values were not being printed\r\n    in accordance with their correct mapping.\r\n* `tf.train.Checkpoint`:\r\n  * Now accepts a `root` argument in the initialization, which generates a checkpoint with a root object. This allows users to create a `Checkpoint` object that     is compatible with Keras `model.save_weights()` and `model.load_weights`. The checkpoint is also compatible with the checkpoint saved in the `variables/`         folder in the SavedModel.\r\n  * When restoring, `save_path` can be a path to a SavedModel. The function will automatically find the checkpoint in the SavedModel.\r\n  \r\n### `tf.data`:\r\n  * Adds new `tf.data.experimental.service.register_dataset` and `tf.data.experimental.service.from_dataset_id` APIs to enable one\r\n    process to register a dataset with the tf.data service, and another process to consume data from the dataset.\r\n  * Adds support for dispatcher fault tolerance. To enable fault tolerance, configure a `work_dir` when running your dispatcher server and set\r\n    `dispatcher_fault_tolerance=True`. The dispatcher will store its state to `work_dir`, so that on restart it can continue from its previous\r\n    state after restart.\r\n  * Adds support for sharing dataset graphs via shared filesystem instead of over RPC. This reduces load on the dispatcher, improving performance\r\n    of distributing datasets. For this to work, the dispatcher's `work_dir` must be accessible from workers. If the worker fails to read from the\r\n    `work_dir`, it falls back to using RPC for dataset graph transfer.\r\n  * Adds support for a new \"distributed_epoch\" processing mode. This processing mode distributes a dataset across all tf.data workers,\r\n    instead of having each worker process the full dataset. See [the tf.data service docs](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/data/experimental/service#understand_processing_mode) to learn more.\r\n  * Adds optional `exclude_cols` parameter to CsvDataset. This parameter is the complement of `select_cols`; at most one of these should be specified.\r\n  * We have implemented an optimization which reorders data-discarding transformations such as `take` and `shard` to happen earlier in the dataset when it is           safe to do so. The optimization can be disabled via the `experimental_optimization.reorder_data_discarding_ops` dataset option.\r\n  * `tf.data.Options` were previously immutable and can now be overridden.\r\n  * `tf.data.Dataset.from_generator` now supports Ragged and Sparse tensors with a new `output_signature` argument, which allows `from_generator` to\r\n    produce any type describable by a `tf.TypeSpec`.\r\n  * `tf.data.experimental.AUTOTUNE` is now available in the core API as `tf.data.AUTOTUNE`.\r\n\r\n### `tf.distribute`:\r\n  * Introduces experimental support for asynchronous training of Keras models via `tf.distribute.experimental.ParameterServerStrategy`:\r\n    * Replaces the existing `tf.distribute.experimental.ParameterServerStrategy` symbol with a new class that is for parameter server training in TF2. Usage of\r\n      the old symbol, usually with Estimator API, should be **replaced** with [`tf.compat.v1.distribute.experimental.ParameterServerStrategy`].\r\n    * Added `tf.distribute.experimental.coordinator.*` namespace, including the main API `ClusterCoordinator` for coordinating the training cluster, the related       data structure `RemoteValue` and `PerWorkerValue`.\r\n  * Adds `tf.distribute.Strategy.gather` and `tf.distribute.ReplicaContext.all_gather` APIs to support gathering dense distributed values.\r\n  * Fixes various issues with saving a distributed model.\r\n\r\n### `tf.keras`:\r\n  * Improvements from the Functional API refactoring:\r\n    * Functional model construction does not need to maintain a global workspace graph, removing memory leaks especially when building many\r\n      models or very large models.\r\n    * Functional model construction should be ~8-10% faster on average.\r\n    * Functional models can now contain non-symbolic values in their call inputs inside of the first positional argument.\r\n    * Several classes of TF ops that were not reliably converted to Keras layers during functional API construction should now work, e.g.\r\n      `tf.image.ssim_multiscale`\r\n    * Error messages when Functional API construction goes wrong (and when ops cannot be converted to Keras layers automatically) should be\r\n      clearer and easier to understand.\r\n  * `Optimizer.minimize` can now accept a loss `Tensor` and a `GradientTape` as an alternative to accepting a `callable` loss.\r\n  * Adds `beta` hyperparameter to FTRL optimizer classes (Keras and others) to match [FTRL paper](https://research.google.com/pubs/archive/41159.pdf).  \r\n  * `Optimizer.__init__` now accepts a `gradient_aggregator` to allow for customization of how gradients are aggregated across devices, as well as\r\n     `gradients_transformers` to allow for custom gradient transformations (such as gradient clipping).\r\n  * Improvements to Keras preprocessing layers:\r\n    * TextVectorization can now accept a vocabulary list or file as an init arg.\r\n    * Normalization can now accept mean and variance values as init args.\r\n  * In `Attention` and `AdditiveAttention` layers, the `call()` method now accepts a `return_attention_scores` argument. When set to\r\n    True, the layer returns the attention scores as an additional output argument.\r\n  * Adds `tf.metrics.log_cosh` and `tf.metrics.logcosh` API entrypoints with the same implementation as their `tf.losses` equivalent.\r\n  * For Keras model, the individual call of `Model.evaluate` uses no cached data for evaluation, while `Model.fit` uses cached data when\r\n    `validation_data` arg is provided for better performance.\r\n  * Adds a `save_traces` argument to `model.save`/ `tf.keras.models.save_model` which determines whether the SavedModel format stores the Keras model/layer call     functions. The traced functions allow Keras to revive custom models and layers without the original class definition, but if this isn't required the tracing     can be disabled with the added option.\r\n\r\n### `tf.lite`:\r\n  * `TFLiteConverter`:\r\n    * Support optional flags `inference_input_type` and `inference_output_type` for full integer quantized models. This allows users to modify the model input         and output type to integer types (`tf.int8`, `tf.uint8`) instead of defaulting to float type (`tf.float32`). \r\n  * NNAPI\r\n    * Adds NNAPI Delegation support for requantization use cases by converting the operation into a dequantize-quantize pair.\r\n    * Removes deprecated `Interpreter.setUseNNAPI(boolean)` Java API. Use `Interpreter.Options.setUseNNAPI` instead.\r\n    * Deprecates `Interpreter::UseNNAPI(bool)` C++ API. Use `NnApiDelegate()` and related delegate configuration methods directly.\r\n    * Deprecates `Interpreter::SetAllowFp16PrecisionForFp32(bool)` C++ API. Prefer controlling this via delegate options, e.g. `tflite::StatefulNnApiDelegate::Options::allow_fp16' or `TfLiteGpuDelegateOptionsV2::is_precision_loss_allowed`.\r\n  * GPU\r\n    * GPU acceleration now supports quantized models by default\r\n  * `DynamicBuffer::AddJoinedString()` will now add a separator if the first string to be joined is empty.\r\n  *  Adds support for cumulative sum (cumsum), both as builtin op and MLIR conversion.\r\n  \r\n### `TensorRT`\r\n  * Issues a warning when the `session_config` parameter for the TF1 converter is used or the `rewrite_config_template` field in the TF2\r\n    converter parameter object is used.\r\n    \r\n### TPU Enhancements:\r\n  * Adds support for the `beta` parameter of the FTRL optimizer for TPU embeddings. Users of other TensorFlow platforms can implement equivalent\r\n    behavior by adjusting the `l2` parameter.\r\n\r\n### XLA Support:\r\n  * xla.experimental.compile is deprecated, use `tf.function(experimental_compile=True)` instead. \r\n  * Adds `tf.function.experimental_get_compiler_ir` which returns compiler IR (currently 'hlo' and 'optimized_hlo') for given input for given function.\r\n  \r\n### Security:\r\n  * Fixes an undefined behavior causing a segfault in `tf.raw_ops.Switch`, ([CVE-2020-15190](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-15190))\r\n  * Fixes three vulnerabilities in conversion to DLPack format\r\n    * [CVE-2020-15191](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-15191),\r\n    * [CVE-2020-15192](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-15192),\r\n    * [CVE-2020-15193](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-15193)\r\n  * Fixes two vulnerabilities in `SparseFillEmptyRowsGrad`\r\n    * [CVE-2020-15194](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-15194),\r\n    * [CVE-2020-15195](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-15195)\r\n  * Fixes several vulnerabilities in `RaggedCountSparseOutput` and `SparseCountSparseOutput` operations\r\n    * [CVE-2020-15196](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-15196),\r\n    * [CVE-2020-15197](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-15197),\r\n    * [CVE-2020-15198](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-15198),\r\n    * [CVE-2020-15199](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-15199),\r\n    * [CVE-2020-15200](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-15200),\r\n    * [CVE-2020-15201](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-15201)\r\n  * Fixes an integer truncation vulnerability in code using the work sharder API, ([CVE-2020-15202](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-15202))\r\n  * Fixes a format string vulnerability in `tf.strings.as_string`, ([CVE-2020-15203](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-15203))\r\n  * Fixes segfault raised by calling session-only ops in eager mode, ([CVE-2020-15204](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-15204))\r\n  * Fixes data leak and potential ASLR violation from `tf.raw_ops.StringNGrams`, ([CVE-2020-15205](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-15205))\r\n  * Fixes segfaults caused by incomplete `SavedModel` validation, ([CVE-2020-15206](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-15206))\r\n  * Fixes a data corruption due to a bug in negative indexing support in TFLite, ([CVE-2020-15207](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-15207))\r\n  * Fixes a data corruption due to dimension mismatch in TFLite, ([CVE-2020-15208](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-15208))\r\n  * Fixes several vulnerabilities in TFLite saved model format\r\n    * [CVE-2020-15209](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-15209),\r\n    * [CVE-2020-15210](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-15210),\r\n    * [CVE-2020-15211](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-15211)\r\n  * Fixes several vulnerabilities in TFLite implementation of segment sum\r\n    * [CVE-2020-15212](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-15212),\r\n    * [CVE-2020-15213](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-15213),\r\n    * [CVE-2020-15214](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-15214)\r\n  * Fixes a segfault in `tf.quantization.quantize_and_dequantize`, ([CVE-2020-15265](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-15265))\r\n  * Fixes an undefined behavior float cast causing a crash, ([CVE-2020-15266](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-15266))\r\n    \r\n### Other:\r\n  * We have replaced uses of \"whitelist\" and \"blacklist\" with \"allowlist\" and \"denylist\" where possible.

    "body": "# Release 2.3.0\r\n\r\n## Major Features and Improvements\r\n  * `tf.data` adds two new mechanisms to solve input pipeline bottlenecks and save resources:\r\n    * [snapshot](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/data/experimental/snapshot)\r\n    * [tf.data service](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/data/experimental/service). \r\n\r\n  In addition checkout the detailed [guide](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/data_performance_analysis) for analyzing input pipeline performance with TF Profiler.\r\n\r\n  * [`tf.distribute.TPUStrategy`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/distribute/TPUStrategy) is now a stable API and no longer considered experimental for TensorFlow. (earlier `tf.distribute.experimental.TPUStrategy`).\r\n\r\n  * [TF Profiler](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/profiler) introduces two new tools: a memory profiler to visualize your model’s memory usage over time and a [python tracer](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/profiler#events) which allows you to trace python function calls in your model. Usability improvements include better diagnostic messages and [profile options](https://tensorflow.org/guide/profiler#collect_performance_data) to customize the host and device trace verbosity level.\r\n\r\n  * Introduces experimental support for Keras Preprocessing Layers API ([`tf.keras.layers.experimental.preprocessing.*`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/layers/experimental/preprocessing?version=nightly)) to handle data preprocessing operations, with support for composite tensor inputs. Please see below for additional details on these layers.\r\n  \r\n  * TFLite now properly supports dynamic shapes during conversion and inference. We’ve also added opt-in support on Android and iOS for [XNNPACK](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tensorflow/lite/delegates/xnnpack), a highly optimized set of CPU kernels, as well as opt-in support for [executing quantized models on the GPU](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/lite/g3doc/performance/gpu_advanced.md#running-quantized-models-experimental). \r\n\r\n  * Libtensorflow packages are available in GCS starting this release. We have also started to [release a nightly version of these packages](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow#official-builds). \r\n  \r\n  * The experimental Python API [`tf.debugging.experimental.enable_dump_debug_info()`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/debugging/experimental/enable_dump_debug_info) now allows you to instrument a TensorFlow program and dump debugging information to a directory on the file system. The directory can be read and visualized by a new interactive dashboard in TensorBoard 2.3 called [Debugger V2](https://www.tensorflow.org/tensorboard/debugger_v2), which reveals the details of the TensorFlow program including graph structures, history of op executions at the Python (eager) and intra-graph levels, the runtime dtype, shape, and numerical composistion of tensors, as well as their code locations.\r\n  \r\n## Breaking Changes\r\n* Increases the **minimum bazel version** required to build TF to **3.1.0**.\r\n* `tf.data`\r\n  *  Makes the following (breaking) changes to the `tf.data`.\r\n    * C++ API: - `IteratorBase::RestoreInternal`, `IteratorBase::SaveInternal`, and `DatasetBase::CheckExternalState` become pure-virtual and subclasses are now expected to provide an implementation.\r\n    * The deprecated `DatasetBase::IsStateful` method is removed in favor of `DatasetBase::CheckExternalState`.\r\n    * Deprecated overrides of `DatasetBase::MakeIterator` and `MakeIteratorFromInputElement` are removed.\r\n  * The signature of `tensorflow::data::IteratorBase::SaveInternal` and `tensorflow::data::IteratorBase::SaveInput` has been extended with `SerializationContext` argument to enable overriding the default policy for the handling external state during iterator checkpointing. This is not a backwards compatible change and all subclasses of `IteratorBase` *need to be updated* accordingly.\r\n* `tf.keras`\r\n    * Add a new `BackupAndRestore` callback for handling distributed training failures & restarts. Please take a look at this [tutorial](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/distribute/multi_worker_with_keras) for details on how to use the callback. \r\n* `tf.image.extract_glimpse` has been updated to correctly process the case\r\n   where `centered=False` and `normalized=False`. This is a breaking change as\r\n   the output is different from (incorrect) previous versions. Note this\r\n   breaking change only impacts `tf.image.extract_glimpse` and\r\n   `tf.compat.v2.image.extract_glimpse` API endpoints. The behavior of\r\n   `tf.compat.v1.image.extract_glimpse` does not change. The behavior of\r\n   exsiting C++ kernel `ExtractGlimpse` does not change either, so saved\r\n   models using `tf.raw_ops.ExtractGlimpse` will not be impacted.\r\n\r\n## Known Caveats\r\n  * `tf.lite`\r\n    * Keras-based LSTM models must be converted with an explicit batch size in the input layer.\r\n\r\n## Bug Fixes and Other Changes\r\n\r\n### TF Core:\r\n  * Set `tf2_behavior` to 1 to enable V2 for early loading cases.\r\n  * Add `execute_fn_for_device function` to dynamically choose the implementation based on underlying device placement.\r\n  * Eager:\r\n    * Add `reduce_logsumexp` benchmark with experiment compile.\r\n    * Give `EagerTensor`s a meaningful `__array__` implementation.\r\n    * Add another version of defun matmul for performance analysis.\r\n  * `tf.function`/AutoGraph:\r\n    * `AutoGraph` now includes into TensorFlow loops any variables that are closed over by local functions. Previously, such variables were sometimes incorrectly ignored.\r\n    * functions returned by the `get_concrete_function` method of `tf.function` objects can now be called with arguments consistent with the original arguments or type specs passed to `get_concrete_function`.  This calling convention is now the preferred way to use concrete functions with nested values and composite tensors. Please check the [guide](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/concrete_function) for more details on `concrete_ function`.\r\n    * Update `tf.function`'s `experimental_relax_shapes` to handle composite tensors appropriately.\r\n    * Optimize `tf.function` invocation, by removing redundant list converter.\r\n    * `tf.function` will retrace when called with a different variable instead of simply using the `dtype` & `shape`.\r\n    * [Improve support](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/33862) for dynamically-sized TensorArray inside `tf.function`.\r\n  * `tf.math`:\r\n    * Narrow down `argmin`/`argmax` contract to always return the smallest index for ties.\r\n    * `tf.math.reduce_variance` and `tf.math.reduce_std` return correct computation for complex types and no longer support integer types.\r\n    * Add Bessel functions of order 0,1 to `tf.math.special`.\r\n    * `tf.divide` now always returns a tensor to be consistent with documentation and other APIs.\r\n  * `tf.image`:\r\n    * Replaced [`tf.image.non_max_suppression_padded`](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r2.3/api_docs/python/tf/image/non_max_suppression_padded?hl=en) with a new implementation that supports batched inputs, which is considerably faster on TPUs and GPUs. Boxes with area=0 will be ignored. Existing usage with single inputs should still work as before.\r\n  * `tf.linalg`\r\n    * Add `tf.linalg.banded_triangular_solve`.\r\n  * `tf.random`:\r\n    * Add `tf.random.stateless_parameterized_truncated_normal`.\r\n  * `tf.ragged`:\r\n    * Add `tf.ragged.cross` and `tf.ragged.cross_hashed` operations.\r\n  * `tf.RaggedTensor`:\r\n    * `RaggedTensor.to_tensor()` now preserves static shape.\r\n    * Add `tf.strings.format()` and `tf.print()` to support RaggedTensors.\r\n  * `tf.saved_model`:\r\n    * `@tf.function` from SavedModel no longer ignores args after a `RaggedTensor` when selecting the concrete function to run.\r\n    * Fix save model issue for ops with a list of functions.\r\n    * Add `tf.saved_model.LoadOptions` with [`experimental_io_device`](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r2.3/api_docs/python/tf/saved_model/LoadOptions?hl=en) as arg with default value `None` to choose the I/O device for loading models and weights.\r\n    * Update `tf.saved_model.SaveOptions` with [`experimental_io_device`](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r2.3/api_docs/python/tf/saved_model/SaveOptions?hl=en) as arg with default value `None` to choose the I/O device for saving models and weights.\r\n    * Mutable tables now restore checkpointed values when loaded from SavedModel.\r\n  * GPU\r\n    * TF 2.3 includes PTX kernels only for [compute capability](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-gpus) 7.0 to reduce the TF pip binary size.  Earlier releases included PTX for a variety of older compute capabilities.\r\n  * Others\r\n    * Retain parent namescope for ops added inside `tf.while_loop`/`tf.cond`/`tf.switch_case`.\r\n    * Update `tf.vectorized_map` to support vectorizing `tf.while_loop` and TensorList operations.\r\n    * `tf.custom_gradient` can now be applied to functions that accept nested structures of `tensors` as inputs (instead of just a list of tensors). Note that Python structures such as tuples and lists now won't be treated as tensors, so if you still want them to be treated that way, you need to wrap them with `tf.convert_to_tensor`.\r\n    * No lowering on gradient case op when input is `DeviceIndex` op.\r\n    * Extend the ragged version of `tf.gather` to support `batch_dims` and `axis` args.\r\n    * Update `tf.map_fn` to support RaggedTensors and SparseTensors.\r\n    * Deprecate `tf.group`. It is not useful in eager mode.\r\n    * Add CPU and GPU implementation of modified variation of [`FTRL`](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r2.3/api_docs/python/tf/raw_ops/ApplyFtrl)/[`FTRLV2`](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r2.3/api_docs/python/tf/raw_ops/ApplyFtrlV2) that can triggerred by `multiply_linear_by_lr` allowing a learning rate of zero. \r\n    \r\n### `tf.data`: \r\n  * `tf.data.experimental.dense_to_ragged_batch` works correctly with tuples.\r\n  * `tf.data.experimental.dense_to_ragged_batch` to output variable ragged rank.\r\n  * `tf.data.experimental.cardinality` is now a method on `tf.data.Dataset`.\r\n  * `tf.data.Dataset` now supports `len(Dataset)` when the cardinality is finite.\r\n\r\n### `tf.distribute`: \r\n  * Expose experimental [`tf.distribute.DistributedDataset`](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r2.3/api_docs/python/tf/distribute/DistributedDataset?hl=en) and [`tf.distribute.DistributedIterator`](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r2.3/api_docs/python/tf/distribute/DistributedIterator) to distribute input data when using `tf.distribute` to scale training on multiple devices. \r\n    * Added a [`get_next_as_optional`](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r2.3/api_docs/python/tf/distribute/DistributedIterator?hl=en#get_next_as_optional) method for [`tf.distribute.DistributedIterator`](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r2.3/api_docs/python/tf/distribute/DistributedIterator?hl=en) class to return a `tf.experimental.Optional` instance that contains the next value for all replicas or none instead of raising an out of range error. Also see *new* [guide on input distribution](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/distribute/input).\r\n  * Allow var.assign on MirroredVariables with aggregation=NONE in replica context. Previously this would raise an error. We now allow this because many users and library writers find using `.assign` in replica context to be more convenient, instead of having to use `Strategy.extended.update` which was the previous way of updating variables in this situation.\r\n  * `tf.distribute.experimental.MultiWorkerMirroredStrategy` adds support for partial batches. Workers running out of data now continue to participate in the training with empty inputs, instead of raising an error. Learn more about [partial batches here](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/distribute/input#partial_batches).\r\n  * Improve the performance of reading metrics eagerly under `tf.distribute.experimental.MultiWorkerMirroredStrategy`.\r\n  * Fix the issue that `strategy.reduce()` inside `tf.function` may raise exceptions when the values to reduce are from loops or if-clauses.\r\n  * Fix the issue that `tf.distribute.MirroredStrategy` cannot be used together with `tf.distribute.experimental.MultiWorkerMirroredStrategy`.\r\n  * Add a `tf.distribute.cluster_resolver.TPUClusterResolver.connect` API to simplify TPU initialization.\r\n\r\n### `tf.keras`:\r\n  * Introduces experimental preprocessing layers API (`tf.keras.layers.experimental.preprocessing`)  to handle data preprocessing operations such as categorical feature encoding, text vectorization, data normalization, and data discretization (binning). The newly added layers provide a replacement for the  legacy feature column API, and support composite tensor inputs. \r\n  * Added **categorical data** processing layers:\r\n    * `IntegerLookup` & `StringLookup`: build an index of categorical feature values\r\n    * `CategoryEncoding`: turn integer-encoded categories into one-hot, multi-hot, or tf-idf encoded representations\r\n    * `CategoryCrossing`: create new categorical features representing co-occurrences of previous categorical feature values\r\n    * `Hashing`: the hashing trick, for large-vocabulary categorical features\r\n    * `Discretization`: turn continuous numerical features into categorical features by binning their values\r\n  * Improved **image preprocessing** layers: `CenterCrop`, `Rescaling`\r\n  * Improved **image augmentation** layers: `RandomCrop`, `RandomFlip`, `RandomTranslation`, `RandomRotation`, `RandomHeight`, `RandomWidth`, `RandomZoom`, `RandomContrast`\r\n  * Improved **`TextVectorization`** layer, which handles string tokenization, n-gram generation, and token encoding\r\n    * The `TextVectorization` layer now accounts for the mask_token as part of the vocabulary size when output_mode='int'. This means that, if you have a max_tokens value of 5000, your output will have 5000 unique values (not 5001 as before).\r\n    * Change the return value of `TextVectorization.get_vocabulary()` from `byte` to `string`. Users who previously were calling 'decode' on the output of this method should no longer need to do so.\r\n  * Introduce new Keras dataset generation utilities :\r\n    * **[`image_dataset_from_directory`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/preprocessing/image_dataset_from_directory)** is a utility based on `tf.data.Dataset`, meant to replace the legacy `ImageDataGenerator`. It takes you from a structured directory of images to a labeled dataset, in one function call. Note that it doesn't perform image data augmentation (which is meant to be done using preprocessing layers).\r\n    * **[`text_dataset_from_directory`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/preprocessing/text_dataset_from_directory)** takes you from a structured directory of text files to a labeled dataset, in one function call.\r\n    * **[`timeseries_dataset_from_array`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/preprocessing/timeseries_dataset_from_array)** is a `tf.data.Dataset`-based replacement of the legacy `TimeseriesGenerator`. It takes you from an array of timeseries data to a dataset of shifting windows with their targets.\r\n  * Added [`experimental_steps_per_execution`](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r2.3/api_docs/python/tf/keras/Model?hl=en#compile)\r\n arg to `model.compile` to indicate the number of batches to run per `tf.function` call. This can speed up Keras Models on TPUs up to 3x.\r\n  * Extends `tf.keras.layers.Lambda` layers to support multi-argument lambdas, and keyword arguments when calling the layer.\r\n  * Functional models now get constructed if *any* tensor in a layer call's arguments/keyword arguments comes from a keras input. Previously the functional api would only work if all of the elements in the first argument to the layer came from a keras input.\r\n  * Clean up `BatchNormalization` layer's `trainable` property to act like standard python state when it's used inside `tf.functions` (frozen at tracing time), instead of acting like a pseudo-variable whose updates *kind of sometimes* get reflected in already-traced `tf.function` traces.\r\n  * Add the `Conv1DTranspose` layer.\r\n  * Refine the semantics of `SensitivitySpecificityBase` derived metrics. See the updated API docstrings for [`tf.keras.metrics.SensitivityAtSpecificity`](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r2.3/api_docs/python/tf/keras/metrics/SensitivityAtSpecificity) and [`tf.keras.metrics.SpecificityAtSensitivty`](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r2.3/api_docs/python/tf/keras/metrics/SpecificityAtSensitivity). \r\n\r\n### `tf.lite`:\r\n  * Converter\r\n      * Restored `inference_input_type` and `inference_output_type` flags in TF 2.x TFLiteConverter (backward compatible with TF 1.x) to support integer (tf.int8, tf.uint8) input and output types in post training full integer quantized models.\r\n      * Added support for converting and resizing models with dynamic (placeholder) dimensions. Previously, there was only limited support for dynamic batch size, and even that did not guarantee that the model could be properly resized at runtime.\r\n       * Enabled experimental support for a new quantization mode with 16-bit activations and 8-bit weights.

    "body": "# Release 2.3.0\r\n\r\n## Major Features and Improvements\r\n  * `tf.data` adds two new mechanisms to solve input pipeline bottlenecks and save resources:\r\n    * [snapshot](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/data/experimental/snapshot)\r\n    * [tf.data service](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/data/experimental/service). \r\n\r\n  In addition checkout the detailed [guide](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/data_performance_analysis) for analyzing input pipeline performance with TF Profiler.\r\n\r\n  * [`tf.distribute.TPUStrategy`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/distribute/TPUStrategy) is now a stable API and no longer considered experimental for TensorFlow. (earlier `tf.distribute.experimental.TPUStrategy`).\r\n\r\n  * [TF Profiler](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/profiler) introduces two new tools: a memory profiler to visualize your model’s memory usage over time and a [python tracer](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/profiler#events) which allows you to trace python function calls in your model. Usability improvements include better diagnostic messages and [profile options](https://tensorflow.org/guide/profiler#collect_performance_data) to customize the host and device trace verbosity level.\r\n\r\n  * Introduces experimental support for Keras Preprocessing Layers API ([`tf.keras.layers.experimental.preprocessing.*`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/layers/experimental/preprocessing?version=nightly)) to handle data preprocessing operations, with support for composite tensor inputs. Please see below for additional details on these layers.\r\n  \r\n  * TFLite now properly supports dynamic shapes during conversion and inference. We’ve also added opt-in support on Android and iOS for [XNNPACK](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tensorflow/lite/delegates/xnnpack), a highly optimized set of CPU kernels, as well as opt-in support for [executing quantized models on the GPU](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/lite/g3doc/performance/gpu_advanced.md#running-quantized-models-experimental). \r\n\r\n  * Libtensorflow packages are available in GCS starting this release. We have also started to [release a nightly version of these packages](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow#official-builds). \r\n  \r\n  * The experimental Python API [`tf.debugging.experimental.enable_dump_debug_info()`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/debugging/experimental/enable_dump_debug_info) now allows you to instrument a TensorFlow program and dump debugging information to a directory on the file system. The directory can be read and visualized by a new interactive dashboard in TensorBoard 2.3 called [Debugger V2](https://www.tensorflow.org/tensorboard/debugger_v2), which reveals the details of the TensorFlow program including graph structures, history of op executions at the Python (eager) and intra-graph levels, the runtime dtype, shape, and numerical composistion of tensors, as well as their code locations.\r\n  \r\n## Breaking Changes\r\n* Increases the **minimum bazel version** required to build TF to **3.1.0**.\r\n* `tf.data`\r\n  *  Makes the following (breaking) changes to the `tf.data`.\r\n    * C++ API: - `IteratorBase::RestoreInternal`, `IteratorBase::SaveInternal`, and `DatasetBase::CheckExternalState` become pure-virtual and subclasses are now expected to provide an implementation.\r\n    * The deprecated `DatasetBase::IsStateful` method is removed in favor of `DatasetBase::CheckExternalState`.\r\n    * Deprecated overrides of `DatasetBase::MakeIterator` and `MakeIteratorFromInputElement` are removed.\r\n  * The signature of `tensorflow::data::IteratorBase::SaveInternal` and `tensorflow::data::IteratorBase::SaveInput` has been extended with `SerializationContext` argument to enable overriding the default policy for the handling external state during iterator checkpointing. This is not a backwards compatible change and all subclasses of `IteratorBase` *need to be updated* accordingly.\r\n* `tf.keras`\r\n    * Add a new `BackupAndRestore` callback for handling distributed training failures & restarts. Please take a look at this [tutorial](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/distribute/multi_worker_with_keras) for details on how to use the callback. \r\n* `tf.image.extract_glimpse` has been updated to correctly process the case\r\n   where `centered=False` and `normalized=False`. This is a breaking change as\r\n   the output is different from (incorrect) previous versions. Note this\r\n   breaking change only impacts `tf.image.extract_glimpse` and\r\n   `tf.compat.v2.image.extract_glimpse` API endpoints. The behavior of\r\n   `tf.compat.v1.image.extract_glimpse` does not change. The behavior of\r\n   exsiting C++ kernel `ExtractGlimpse` does not change either, so saved\r\n   models using `tf.raw_ops.ExtractGlimpse` will not be impacted.\r\n\r\n## Bug Fixes and Other Changes\r\n\r\n### TF Core:\r\n  * Set `tf2_behavior` to 1 to enable V2 for early loading cases.\r\n  * Add `execute_fn_for_device function` to dynamically choose the implementation based on underlying device placement.\r\n  * Eager:\r\n    * Add `reduce_logsumexp` benchmark with experiment compile.\r\n    * Give `EagerTensor`s a meaningful `__array__` implementation.\r\n    * Add another version of defun matmul for performance analysis.\r\n  * `tf.function`/AutoGraph:\r\n    * `AutoGraph` now includes into TensorFlow loops any variables that are closed over by local functions. Previously, such variables were sometimes incorrectly ignored.\r\n    * functions returned by the `get_concrete_function` method of `tf.function` objects can now be called with arguments consistent with the original arguments or type specs passed to `get_concrete_function`.  This calling convention is now the preferred way to use concrete functions with nested values and composite tensors. Please check the [guide](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/concrete_function) for more details on `concrete_ function`.\r\n    * Update `tf.function`'s `experimental_relax_shapes` to handle composite tensors appropriately.\r\n    * Optimize `tf.function` invocation, by removing redundant list converter.\r\n    * `tf.function` will retrace when called with a different variable instead of simply using the `dtype` & `shape`.\r\n    * [Improve support](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/33862) for dynamically-sized TensorArray inside `tf.function`.\r\n  * `tf.math`:\r\n    * Narrow down `argmin`/`argmax` contract to always return the smallest index for ties.\r\n    * `tf.math.reduce_variance` and `tf.math.reduce_std` return correct computation for complex types and no longer support integer types.\r\n    * Add Bessel functions of order 0,1 to `tf.math.special`.\r\n    * `tf.divide` now always returns a tensor to be consistent with documentation and other APIs.\r\n  * `tf.image`:\r\n    * Replaced [`tf.image.non_max_suppression_padded`](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r2.3/api_docs/python/tf/image/non_max_suppression_padded?hl=en) with a new implementation that supports batched inputs, which is considerably faster on TPUs and GPUs. Boxes with area=0 will be ignored. Existing usage with single inputs should still work as before.\r\n  * `tf.linalg`\r\n    * Add `tf.linalg.banded_triangular_solve`.\r\n  * `tf.random`:\r\n    * Add `tf.random.stateless_parameterized_truncated_normal`.\r\n  * `tf.ragged`:\r\n    * Add `tf.ragged.cross` and `tf.ragged.cross_hashed` operations.\r\n  * `tf.RaggedTensor`:\r\n    * `RaggedTensor.to_tensor()` now preserves static shape.\r\n    * Add `tf.strings.format()` and `tf.print()` to support RaggedTensors.\r\n  * `tf.saved_model`:\r\n    * `@tf.function` from SavedModel no longer ignores args after a `RaggedTensor` when selecting the concrete function to run.\r\n    * Fix save model issue for ops with a list of functions.\r\n    * Add `tf.saved_model.LoadOptions` with [`experimental_io_device`](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r2.3/api_docs/python/tf/saved_model/LoadOptions?hl=en) as arg with default value `None` to choose the I/O device for loading models and weights.\r\n     * Update `tf.saved_model.SaveOptions` with [`experimental_io_device`](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r2.3/api_docs/python/tf/saved_model/SaveOptions?hl=en) as arg with default value `None` to choose the I/O device for saving models and weights.\r\n  * GPU\r\n    * No longer includes PTX kernels for GPU except for sm_70 to reduce binary size.\r\n  * Others\r\n    * Retain parent namescope for ops added inside `tf.while_loop`/`tf.cond`/`tf.switch_case`.\r\n    * Update `tf.vectorized_map` to support vectorizing `tf.while_loop` and TensorList operations.\r\n    * `tf.custom_gradient` can now be applied to functions that accept nested structures of `tensors` as inputs (instead of just a list of tensors). Note that Python structures such as tuples and lists now won't be treated as tensors, so if you still want them to be treated that way, you need to wrap them with `tf.convert_to_tensor`.\r\n    * No lowering on gradient case op when input is `DeviceIndex` op.\r\n    * Extend the ragged version of `tf.gather` to support `batch_dims` and `axis` args.\r\n    * Update `tf.map_fn` to support RaggedTensors and SparseTensors.\r\n    * Deprecate `tf.group`. It is not useful in eager mode.\r\n    * Add CPU and GPU implementation of modified variation of [`FTRL`](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r2.3/api_docs/python/tf/raw_ops/ApplyFtrl)/[`FTRLV2`](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r2.3/api_docs/python/tf/raw_ops/ApplyFtrlV2) that can triggerred by `multiply_linear_by_lr` allowing a learning rate of zero. \r\n    \r\n### `tf.data`: \r\n  * `tf.data.experimental.dense_to_ragged_batch` works correctly with tuples.\r\n  * `tf.data.experimental.dense_to_ragged_batch` to output variable ragged rank.\r\n  * `tf.data.experimental.cardinality` is now a method on `tf.data.Dataset`.\r\n  * `tf.data.Dataset` now supports `len(Dataset)` when the cardinality is finite.\r\n\r\n### `tf.distribute`: \r\n  * Expose experimental [`tf.distribute.DistributedDataset`](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r2.3/api_docs/python/tf/distribute/DistributedDataset?hl=en) and [`tf.distribute.DistributedIterator`](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r2.3/api_docs/python/tf/distribute/DistributedIterator) to distribute input data when using `tf.distribute` to scale training on multiple devices. \r\n    * Added a [`get_next_as_optional`](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r2.3/api_docs/python/tf/distribute/DistributedIterator?hl=en#get_next_as_optional) method for [`tf.distribute.DistributedIterator`](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r2.3/api_docs/python/tf/distribute/DistributedIterator?hl=en) class to return a `tf.experimental.Optional` instance that contains the next value for all replicas or none instead of raising an out of range error. Also see *new* [guide on input distribution](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/distribute/input).\r\n  * Allow var.assign on MirroredVariables with aggregation=NONE in replica context. Previously this would raise an error. We now allow this because many users and library writers find using `.assign` in replica context to be more convenient, instead of having to use `Strategy.extended.update` which was the previous way of updating variables in this situation.\r\n  * `tf.distribute.experimental.MultiWorkerMirroredStrategy` adds support for partial batches. Workers running out of data now continue to participate in the training with empty inputs, instead of raising an error. Learn more about [partial batches here](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/distribute/input#partial_batches).\r\n  * Improve the performance of reading metrics eagerly under `tf.distribute.experimental.MultiWorkerMirroredStrategy`.\r\n  * Fix the issue that `strategy.reduce()` inside `tf.function` may raise exceptions when the values to reduce are from loops or if-clauses.\r\n  * Fix the issue that `tf.distribute.MirroredStrategy` cannot be used together with `tf.distribute.experimental.MultiWorkerMirroredStrategy`.\r\n  * Add a `tf.distribute.cluster_resolver.TPUClusterResolver.connect` API to simplify TPU initialization.\r\n\r\n### `tf.keras`:\r\n  * Introduces experimental preprocessing layers API (`tf.keras.layers.experimental.preprocessing`)  to handle data preprocessing operations such as categorical feature encoding, text vectorization, data normalization, and data discretization (binning). The newly added layers provide a replacement for the  legacy feature column API, and support composite tensor inputs. \r\n  * Added **categorical data** processing layers:\r\n    * `IntegerLookup` & `StringLookup`: build an index of categorical feature values\r\n    * `CategoryEncoding`: turn integer-encoded categories into one-hot, multi-hot, or tf-idf encoded representations\r\n    * `CategoryCrossing`: create new categorical features representing co-occurrences of previous categorical feature values\r\n    * `Hashing`: the hashing trick, for large-vocabulary categorical features\r\n    * `Discretization`: turn continuous numerical features into categorical features by binning their values\r\n  * Improved **image preprocessing** layers: `CenterCrop`, `Rescaling`\r\n  * Improved **image augmentation** layers: `RandomCrop`, `RandomFlip`, `RandomTranslation`, `RandomRotation`, `RandomHeight`, `RandomWidth`, `RandomZoom`, `RandomContrast`\r\n  * Improved **`TextVectorization`** layer, which handles string tokenization, n-gram generation, and token encoding\r\n    * The `TextVectorization` layer now accounts for the mask_token as part of the vocabulary size when output_mode='int'. This means that, if you have a max_tokens value of 5000, your output will have 5000 unique values (not 5001 as before).\r\n    * Change the return value of `TextVectorization.get_vocabulary()` from `byte` to `string`. Users who previously were calling 'decode' on the output of this method should no longer need to do so.\r\n  * Introduce new Keras dataset generation utilities :\r\n    * **[`image_dataset_from_directory`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/preprocessing/image_dataset_from_directory)** is a utility based on `tf.data.Dataset`, meant to replace the legacy `ImageDataGenerator`. It takes you from a structured directory of images to a labeled dataset, in one function call. Note that it doesn't perform image data augmentation (which is meant to be done using preprocessing layers).\r\n    * **[`text_dataset_from_directory`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/preprocessing/text_dataset_from_directory)** takes you from a structured directory of text files to a labeled dataset, in one function call.\r\n    * **[`timeseries_dataset_from_array`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/preprocessing/timeseries_dataset_from_array)** is a `tf.data.Dataset`-based replacement of the legacy `TimeseriesGenerator`. It takes you from an array of timeseries data to a dataset of shifting windows with their targets.\r\n  * Added [`experimental_steps_per_execution`](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r2.3/api_docs/python/tf/keras/Model?hl=en#compile)\r\n arg to `model.compile` to indicate the number of batches to run per `tf.function` call. This can speed up Keras Models on TPUs up to 3x.\r\n  * Extends `tf.keras.layers.Lambda` layers to support multi-argument lambdas, and keyword arguments when calling the layer.\r\n  * Functional models now get constructed if *any* tensor in a layer call's arguments/keyword arguments comes from a keras input. Previously the functional api would only work if all of the elements in the first argument to the layer came from a keras input.\r\n  * Clean up `BatchNormalization` layer's `trainable` property to act like standard python state when it's used inside `tf.functions` (frozen at tracing time), instead of acting like a pseudo-variable whose updates *kind of sometimes* get reflected in already-traced `tf.function` traces.\r\n  * Add the `Conv1DTranspose` layer.\r\n  * Refine the semantics of `SensitivitySpecificityBase` derived metrics. See the updated API docstrings for [`tf.keras.metrics.SensitivityAtSpecificity`](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r2.3/api_docs/python/tf/keras/metrics/SensitivityAtSpecificity) and [`tf.keras.metrics.SpecificityAtSensitivty`](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r2.3/api_docs/python/tf/keras/metrics/SpecificityAtSensitivity). \r\n\r\n### `tf.lite`:\r\n  * Converter\r\n      * Restored `inference_input_type` and `inference_output_type` flags in TF 2.x TFLiteConverter (backward compatible with TF 1.x) to support integer (tf.int8, tf.uint8) input and output types in post training full integer quantized models.\r\n      * Added support for converting and resizing models with dynamic (placeholder) dimensions. Previously, there was only limited support for dynamic batch size, and even that did not guarantee that the model could be properly resized at runtime.\r\n       * Enabled experimental support for a new quantization mode with 16-bit activations and 8-bit weights.

    "body": "# Release 2.3.0\r\n\r\n## Major Features and Improvements\r\n  * `tf.data` adds two new mechanisms to solve input pipeline bottlenecks and save resources:\r\n    * [snapshot](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/data/experimental/snapshot)\r\n    * [tf.data service](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/data/experimental/service)\r\n\r\n  In addition checkout the detailed [guide](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/data_performance_analysis) for analyzing input pipeline performance with TF Profiler.\r\n\r\n  * [`tf.distribute.TPUStrategy`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/distribute/TPUStrategy) is now a stable API and no longer considered experimental for TensorFlow. (earlier `tf.distribute.experimental.TPUStrategy`).\r\n\r\n  * [TF Profiler](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/profiler) introduces two new tools: a memory profiler to visualize your model’s memory usage over time and a python tracer which allows you to trace python function calls in your model. Usability improvements include better diagnostic messages and [profile options](https://tensorflow.org/guide/profiler#collect_performance_data) to customize the host and device trace verbosity level.\r\n\r\n  * Introduces experimental support for Keras Preprocessing Layers API ([`tf.keras.layers.experimental.preprocessing.*`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/layers/experimental/preprocessing?version=nightly)) to handle data preprocessing operations, with support for composite tensor inputs. Please see below for additional details on these layers.\r\n  \r\n  * TFLite now properly supports dynamic shapes during conversion and inference. We’ve also added opt-in support on Android and iOS for [XNNPACK](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tensorflow/lite/delegates/xnnpack), a highly optimized set of CPU kernels, as well as opt-in support for [executing quantized models on the GPU](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/lite/g3doc/performance/gpu_advanced.md#running-quantized-models-experimental). \r\n\r\n  * Libtensorflow packages are available in GCS starting this release. We have also started to release a nightly version of these packages. \r\n\r\n## Breaking Changes\r\n* Increases the **minimum bazel version** required to build TF to **3.1.0**.\r\n* `tf.data`\r\n  *  Makes the following (breaking) changes to the `tf.data`.\r\n    * C++ API: - `IteratorBase::RestoreInternal`, `IteratorBase::SaveInternal`, and `DatasetBase::CheckExternalState` become pure-virtual and subclasses are now expected to provide an implementation.\r\n    * The deprecated `DatasetBase::IsStateful` method is removed in favor of `DatasetBase::CheckExternalState`.\r\n    * Deprecated overrides of `DatasetBase::MakeIterator` and `MakeIteratorFromInputElement` are removed.\r\n  * The signature of `tensorflow::data::IteratorBase::SaveInternal` and `tensorflow::data::IteratorBase::SaveInput` has been extended with `SerializationContext` argument to enable overriding the default policy for the handling external state during iterator checkpointing. This is not a backwards compatible change and all subclasses of `IteratorBase` *need to be updated* accordingly.\r\n* `tf.keras`\r\n    * Add a new `BackupAndRestore` callback for handling distributed training failures & restarts. Please take a look at this [tutorial](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/distribute/multi_worker_with_keras) for details on how to use the callback. \r\n* `tf.image.extract_glimpse` has been updated to correctly process the case\r\n   where `centered=False` and `normalized=False`. This is a breaking change as\r\n   the output is different from (incorrect) previous versions. Note this\r\n   breaking change only impacts `tf.image.extract_glimpse` and\r\n   `tf.compat.v2.image.extract_glimpse` API endpoints. The behavior of\r\n   `tf.compat.v1.image.extract_glimpse` does not change. The behavior of\r\n   exsiting C++ kernel `ExtractGlimpse` does not change either, so saved\r\n   models using `tf.raw_ops.ExtractGlimpse` will not be impacted.\r\n\r\n## Bug Fixes and Other Changes\r\n\r\n### TF Core:\r\n  * Set `tf2_behavior` to 1 to enable V2 for early loading cases.\r\n  * Add a function to dynamically choose the implementation based on underlying device placement.\r\n  * Eager:\r\n    * Add `reduce_logsumexp` benchmark with experiment compile.\r\n    * Give `EagerTensor`s a meaningful `__array__` implementation.\r\n    * Add another version of defun matmul for performance analysis.\r\n  * `tf.function`/AutoGraph:\r\n    * `AutoGraph` now includes into TensorFlow loops any variables that are closed over by local functions. Previously, such variables were sometimes incorrectly ignored.\r\n    * functions returned by the `get_concrete_function` method of `tf.function` objects can now be called with arguments consistent with the original arguments or type specs passed to `get_concrete_function`.  This calling convention is now the preferred way to use concrete functions with nested values and composite tensors. Please check the [guide](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/concrete_function) for more details on `concrete_ function`.\r\n    * Update `tf.function`'s `experimental_relax_shapes` to handle composite tensors appropriately.\r\n    * Optimize `tf.function` invocation, by removing redundant list converter.\r\n    * `tf.function` will retrace when called with a different variable instead of simply using the `dtype` & `shape`.\r\n    * [Improve support](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/33862) for dynamically-sized TensorArray inside `tf.function`.\r\n  * `tf.math`:\r\n    * Narrow down `argmin`/`argmax` contract to always return the smallest index for ties.\r\n    * `tf.math.reduce_variance` and `tf.math.reduce_std` return correct computation for complex types and no longer support integer types.\r\n    * Add Bessel functions of order 0,1 to `tf.math.special`.\r\n    * `tf.divide` now always returns a tensor to be consistent with documentation and other APIs.\r\n  * `tf.image`:\r\n    * Replaced [`tf.image.non_max_suppression_padded`](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r2.3/api_docs/python/tf/image/non_max_suppression_padded?hl=en) with a new implementation that supports batched inputs, which is considerably faster on TPUs and GPUs. Boxes with area=0 will be ignored. Existing usage with single inputs should still work as before.\r\n  * `tf.linalg`\r\n    * Add `tf.linalg.banded_triangular_solve`.\r\n  * `tf.random`:\r\n    * Add `tf.random.stateless_parameterized_truncated_normal`.\r\n  * `tf.ragged`:\r\n    * Add `tf.ragged.cross` and `tf.ragged.cross_hashed` operations.\r\n  * `tf.RaggedTensor`:\r\n    * `RaggedTensor.to_tensor()` now preserves static shape.\r\n    * Add `tf.strings.format()` and `tf.print()` to support RaggedTensors.\r\n  * `tf.saved_model`:\r\n    * `@tf.function` from SavedModel no longer ignores args after a `RaggedTensor` when selecting the concrete function to run.\r\n    * Fix save model issue for ops with a list of functions.\r\n    * Add `tf.saved_model.LoadOptions` with [`experimental_io_device`](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r2.3/api_docs/python/tf/saved_model/LoadOptions?hl=en) as arg with default value `None` to choose the I/O device for loading models and weights.\r\n     * Update `tf.saved_model.SaveOptions` with [`experimental_io_device`](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r2.3/api_docs/python/tf/saved_model/SaveOptions?hl=en) as arg with default value `None` to choose the I/O device for saving models and weights.\r\n  * GPU\r\n    * No longer includes PTX kernels for GPU except for sm_70 to reduce binary size.\r\n  * Others\r\n    * Retain parent namescope for ops added inside `tf.while_loop`/`tf.cond`/`tf.switch_case`.\r\n    * Update `tf.vectorized_map` to support vectorizing `tf.while_loop` and TensorList operations.\r\n    * `tf.custom_gradient` can now be applied to functions that accept nested structures of `tensors` as inputs (instead of just a list of tensors). Note that Python structures such as tuples and lists now won't be treated as tensors, so if you still want them to be treated that way, you need to wrap them with `tf.convert_to_tensor`.\r\n    * No lowering on gradient case op when input is `DeviceIndex` op.\r\n    * Fix in c_api `DEFINE_GETATTR`.\r\n    * Extend the ragged version of `tf.gather` to support `batch_dims` and `axis` args.\r\n    * Update `tf.map_fn` to support RaggedTensors and SparseTensors.\r\n    * Deprecate `tf.group`. It is not useful in eager mode.\r\n    * Add a new variant of `FTRL` allowing a learning rate of zero.\r\n    \r\n### `tf.data`: \r\n  * `tf.data.experimental.dense_to_ragged_batch` works correctly with tuples.\r\n  * `tf.data.experimental.dense_to_ragged_batch` to output variable ragged rank.\r\n  * `tf.data.experimental.cardinality` is now a method on `tf.data.Dataset`.\r\n  * `tf.data.Dataset` now supports `len(Dataset)` when the cardinality is finite.\r\n\r\n### `tf.distribute`: \r\n  * Expose experimental [`tf.distribute.DistributedDataset`](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r2.3/api_docs/python/tf/distribute/DistributedDataset?hl=en) and [`tf.distribute.DistributedIterator`](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r2.3/api_docs/python/tf/distribute/DistributedIterator) to distribute input data when using `tf.distribute` to scale training on multiple devices. \r\n    * Added a [`get_next_as_optional`](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r2.3/api_docs/python/tf/distribute/DistributedIterator?hl=en#get_next_as_optional) method for [`tf.distribute.DistributedIterator`](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r2.3/api_docs/python/tf/distribute/DistributedIterator?hl=en) class to return a `tf.experimental.Optional` instance that contains the next value for all replicas or none instead of raising an out of range error. Also see *new* [guide on input distribution](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/distribute/input).\r\n  * Allow `var.assign` on `MirroredVariables` with `aggregation=NONE` in replica context. Previously this would raise an error since there was no way to confirm that the values being assigned to the `MirroredVariables` were in fact identical.\r\n  * `tf.distribute.experimental.MultiWorkerMirroredStrategy` adds support for partial batches. Workers running out of data now continue to participate in the training with empty inputs, instead of raising an error.\r\n  * Improve the performance of reading metrics eagerly under `tf.distribute.experimental.MultiWorkerMirroredStrategy`.\r\n  * Fix the issue that `strategy.reduce()` inside `tf.function` may raise exceptions when the values to reduce are from loops or if-clauses.\r\n  * Fix the issue that `tf.distribute.MirroredStrategy` cannot be used together with `tf.distribute.experimental.MultiWorkerMirroredStrategy`.\r\n  * Add a `tf.distribute.cluster_resolver.TPUClusterResolver.connect` API to simplify TPU initialization.\r\n\r\n### `tf.keras`:\r\n  * Introduces experimental preprocessing layers API (`tf.keras.layers.experimental.preprocessing`)  to handle data preprocessing operations such as categorical feature encoding, text vectorization, data normalization, and data discretization (binning). The newly added layers provide a replacement for the  legacy feature column API, and support composite tensor inputs. \r\n  * Added **categorical data** processing layers:\r\n    * `IntegerLookup` & `StringLookup`: build an index of categorical feature values\r\n    * `CategoryEncoding`: turn integer-encoded categories into one-hot, multi-hot, or tf-idf encoded representations\r\n    * `CategoryCrossing`: create new categorical features representing co-occurrences of previous categorical feature values\r\n    * `Hashing`: the hashing trick, for large-vocabulary categorical features\r\n    * `Discretization`: turn continuous numerical features into categorical features by binning their values\r\n  * Improved **image preprocessing** layers: `CenterCrop`, `Rescaling`\r\n  * Improved **image augmentation** layers: `RandomCrop`, `RandomFlip`, `RandomTranslation`, `RandomRotation`, `RandomHeight`, `RandomWidth`, `RandomZoom`, `RandomContrast`\r\n  * Improved **`TextVectorization`** layer, which handles string tokenization, n-gram generation, and token encoding\r\n    * The `TextVectorization` layer now accounts for the mask_token as part of the vocabulary size when output_mode='int'. This means that, if you have a max_tokens value of 5000, your output will have 5000 unique values (not 5001 as before).\r\n    * Change the return value of `TextVectorization.get_vocabulary()` from `byte` to `string`. Users who previously were calling 'decode' on the output of this method should no longer need to do so.\r\n  * Introduce new Keras dataset generation utilities :\r\n    * **[`image_dataset_from_directory`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/preprocessing/image_dataset_from_directory)** is a utility based on `tf.data.Dataset`, meant to replace the legacy `ImageDataGenerator`. It takes you from a structured directory of images to a labeled dataset, in one function call. Note that it doesn't perform image data augmentation (which is meant to be done using preprocessing layers).\r\n    * **[`text_dataset_from_directory`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/preprocessing/text_dataset_from_directory)** takes you from a structured directory of text files to a labeled dataset, in one function call.\r\n    * **[`timeseries_dataset_from_array`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/preprocessing/timeseries_dataset_from_array)** is a `tf.data.Dataset`-based replacement of the legacy `TimeseriesGenerator`. It takes you from an array of timeseries data to a dataset of shifting windows with their targets.\r\n  * Added [`experimental_steps_per_execution`](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r2.3/api_docs/python/tf/keras/Model?hl=en#compile)\r\n arg to `model.compile` to indicate the number of batches to run per `tf.function` call.

    "body": "# Release 2.3.0\r\n\r\n## Major Features and Improvements\r\n  * `tf.data` adds two new mechanisms to solve input pipeline bottlenecks and save resources:\r\n    * [snapshot](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/data/experimental/snapshot)\r\n    * [tf.data service](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/data/experimental/service/distribute). \r\n\r\n  In addition checkout the detailed [guide](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/data_performance_analysis) for analyzing input pipeline performance with TF Profiler.\r\n\r\n  * [`tf.distribute.TPUStrategy`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/distribute/TPUStrategy) is now a stable API and no longer considered experimental for TensorFlow. (earlier `tf.distribute.experimental.TPUStrategy`).\r\n\r\n  * TF Profiler introduces two new tools: a memory profiler to visualize your model’s memory usage over time and a python tracer which allows you to trace python function calls in your model. Usability improvements include better diagnostic messages and profile options to customize the host and device trace verbosity level.\r\n\r\n  * Introduces experimental support for Keras Preprocessing Layers API ([`tf.keras.layers.experimental.preprocessing.*`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/layers/experimental/preprocessing?version=nightly)) to handle data preprocessing operations, with support for composite tensor inputs. Please see below for additional details on these layers.\r\n  \r\n  * TFLite now properly supports dynamic shapes during conversion and inference. We’ve also added opt-in support on Android and iOS for [XNNPACK](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tensorflow/lite/delegates/xnnpack), a highly optimized set of CPU kernels, as well as opt-in support for [executing quantized models on the GPU](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/lite/g3doc/performance/gpu_advanced.md#running-quantized-models-experimental). \r\n\r\n  * Libtensorflow packages are available in GCS starting this release. We have also started to release a nightly version of these packages. \r\n\r\n## Breaking Changes\r\n* Increases the **minimum bazel version** required to build TF to **3.1.0**.\r\n* `tf.data`\r\n  *  Makes the following (breaking) changes to the `tf.data`.\r\n    * C++ API: - `IteratorBase::RestoreInternal`, `IteratorBase::SaveInternal`, and `DatasetBase::CheckExternalState` become pure-virtual and subclasses are now expected to provide an implementation.\r\n    * The deprecated `DatasetBase::IsStateful` method is removed in favor of `DatasetBase::CheckExternalState`.\r\n    * Deprecated overrides of `DatasetBase::MakeIterator` and `MakeIteratorFromInputElement` are removed.\r\n  * The signature of `tensorflow::data::IteratorBase::SaveInternal` and `tensorflow::data::IteratorBase::SaveInput` has been extended with `SerializationContext` argument to enable overriding the default policy for the handling external state during iterator checkpointing. This is not a backwards compatible change and all subclasses of `IteratorBase` *need to be updated* accordingly.\r\n* `tf.keras`\r\n    * Add a new `BackupAndRestore` callback for handling distributed training failures & restarts. Please take a look at this [tutorial](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/distribute/multi_worker_with_keras) for details on how to use the callback. \r\n* `tf.image.extract_glimpse` has been updated to correctly process the case\r\n   where `centered=False` and `normalized=False`. This is a breaking change as\r\n   the output is different from (incorrect) previous versions. Note this\r\n   breaking change only impacts `tf.image.extract_glimpse` and\r\n   `tf.compat.v2.image.extract_glimpse` API endpoints. The behavior of\r\n   `tf.compat.v1.image.extract_glimpse` does not change. The behavior of\r\n   exsiting C++ kernel `ExtractGlimpse` does not change as well, so saved\r\n   models will not be impacted.\r\n\r\n## Bug Fixes and Other Changes\r\n\r\n### TF Core:\r\n  * Set `tf2_behavior` to 1 to enable V2 for early loading cases.\r\n  * Add a function to dynamically choose the implementation based on underlying device placement.\r\n  * Eager:\r\n    * Add `reduce_logsumexp` benchmark with experiment compile.\r\n    * Give `EagerTensor`s a meaningful `__array__` implementation.\r\n    * Add another version of defun matmul for performance analysis.\r\n  * `tf.function`/AutoGraph:\r\n    * `AutoGraph` now includes into TensorFlow loops any variables that are closed over by local functions. Previously, such variables were sometimes incorrectly ignored.\r\n    * functions returned by the `get_concrete_function` method of `tf.function` objects can now be called with arguments consistent with the original arguments or type specs passed to `get_concrete_function`.  This calling convention is now the preferred way to use concrete functions with nested values and composite tensors. Please check the [guide](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/concrete_function) for more details on `concrete_ function`.\r\n    * Update `tf.function`'s `experimental_relax_shapes` to handle composite tensors appropriately.\r\n    * Optimize `tf.function` invocation, by removing redundant list converter.\r\n    * `tf.function` will retrace when called with a different variable instead of simply using the `dtype` & `shape`.\r\n    * [Improve support](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/33862) for dynamically-sized TensorArray inside `tf.function`.\r\n  * `tf.math`:\r\n    * Narrow down `argmin`/`argmax` contract to always return the smallest index for ties.\r\n    * `tf.math.reduce_variance` and `tf.math.reduce_std` return correct computation for complex types and no longer support integer types.\r\n    * Add Bessel functions of order 0,1 to `tf.math.special`.\r\n    * `tf.divide` now always returns a tensor to be consistent with documentation and other APIs.\r\n  * `tf.image`:\r\n    * Replaces [`tf.image.non_max_suppression_padded`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/image/non_max_suppression_padded?hl=en&version=nightly) with a new implementation that supports batched inputs, which is considerably faster on TPUs and GPUs. Boxes with area=0 will be neglected. Existing usage with single inputs should still work as before.\r\n  * `tf.linalg`\r\n    * Add `tf.linalg.banded_triangular_solve`.\r\n  * `tf.random`:\r\n    * Add `tf.random.stateless_parameterized_truncated_normal`.\r\n  * `tf.ragged`:\r\n    * Add `tf.ragged.cross` and `tf.ragged.cross_hashed` operations.\r\n  * `tf.RaggedTensor`:\r\n    * `RaggedTensor.to_tensor()` now preserves static shape.\r\n    * Add `tf.strings.format()` and `tf.print()` to support RaggedTensors.\r\n  * `tf.saved_model`:\r\n    * `@tf.function` from SavedModel no longer ignores args after a `RaggedTensor` when selecting the concrete function to run.\r\n    * Fix save model issue for ops with a list of functions.\r\n    * Add `tf.saved_model.LoadOptions` with [`experimental_io_device`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/saved_model/LoadOptions) as arg with default value `None` to choose the I/O device for loading models and weights.\r\n     * Update `tf.saved_model.SaveOptions` with [`experimental_io_device`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/saved_model/SaveOptions?version=nightly) as arg with default value `None` to choose the I/O device for saving models and weights.\r\n  * GPU\r\n    * No longer includes PTX kernels for GPU except for sm_70 to reduce binary size.\r\n  * Profiler\r\n    * Fix a subtle use-after-free issue in `XStatVisitor::RefValue()`.\r\n  * Others\r\n    * Retain parent namescope for ops added inside `tf.while_loop`/`tf.cond`/`tf.switch_case`.\r\n    * Update `tf.vectorized_map` to support vectorizing `tf.while_loop` and TensorList operations.\r\n    * `tf.custom_gradient` can now be applied to functions that accept nested structures of `tensors` as inputs (instead of just a list of tensors). Note that Python structures such as tuples and lists now won't be treated as tensors, so if you still want them to be treated that way, you need to wrap them with `tf.convert_to_tensor`.\r\n    * No lowering on gradient case op when input is `DeviceIndex` op.\r\n    * Fix in c_api `DEFINE_GETATTR`.\r\n    * Extend the ragged version of `tf.gather` to support `batch_dims` and `axis` args.\r\n    * Update `tf.map_fn` to support RaggedTensors and SparseTensors.\r\n    * Deprecate `tf.group`. It is not useful in eager mode.\r\n    * Add a new variant of `FTRL` allowing a learning rate of zero.\r\n\r\n ### `tf.data`: \r\n  * `tf.data.experimental.dense_to_ragged_batch` works correctly with tuples.\r\n  * `tf.data.experimental.dense_to_ragged_batch` to output variable ragged rank.\r\n  * `tf.data.experimental.cardinality` is now a method on `tf.data.Dataset`.\r\n  * `tf.data.Dataset` now supports `len(Dataset)` when the cardinality is finite.\r\n\r\n### `tf.distribute`: \r\n  * Expose experimental [`tf.distribute.DistributedDataset`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/distribute/DistributedDataset) and [`tf.distribute.DistributedIterator`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/distribute/DistributedIterator) to distribute input data when using `tf.distribute` to scale training on multiple devices. \r\n    * Added a `get_next_as_optional` method for `tf.distribute.DistributedIterator` class to return a `tf.experimental.Optional` instance that contains the next value for all replicas or none instead of raising an out of range error. Also see *new* [guide on input distribution](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/distribute/input).\r\n  * Allow `var.assign` on `MirroredVariables` with `aggregation=NONE` in replica context. Previously this would raise an error since there was no way to confirm that the values being assigned to the `MirroredVariables` were in fact identical.\r\n  * `tf.distribute.experimental.MultiWorkerMirroredStrategy` adds support for partial batches. Workers running out of data now continue to participate in the training with empty inputs, instead of raising an error.\r\n  * Improve the performance of reading metrics eagerly under `tf.distribute.experimental.MultiWorkerMirroredStrategy`.\r\n  * Fix the issue that `strategy.reduce()` inside `tf.function` may raise exceptions when the values to reduce are from loops or if-clauses.\r\n  * Fix the issue that `tf.distribute.MirroredStrategy` cannot be used together with `tf.distribute.experimental.MultiWorkerMirroredStrategy`.\r\n  * Add a `tf.distribute.cluster_resolver.TPUClusterResolver.connect` API to simplify TPU initialization.\r\n\r\n### `tf.keras`:\r\n  * Introduces experimental preprocessing layers API (`tf.keras.layers.experimental.preprocessing`)  to handle data preprocessing operations such as categorical feature encoding, text vectorization, data normalization, and data discretization (binning). The newly added layers provide a replacement for the  legacy feature column API, and support composite tensor inputs. \r\n  * Added **categorical data** processing layers:\r\n    * `IntegerLookup` & `StringLookup`: build an index of categorical feature values\r\n    * `CategoryEncoding`: turn integer-encoded categories into one-hot, multi-hot, or tf-idf encoded representations\r\n    * `CategoryCrossing`: create new categorical features representing co-occurrences of previous categorical feature values\r\n    * `Hashing`: the hashing trick, for large-vocabulary categorical features\r\n    * `Discretization`: turn continuous numerical features into categorical features by binning their values\r\n  * Improved **image preprocessing** layers: `CenterCrop`, `Rescaling`\r\n  * Improved **image augmentation** layers: `RandomCrop`, `RandomFlip`, `RandomTranslation`, `RandomRotation`, `RandomHeight`, `RandomWidth`, `RandomZoom`, `RandomContrast`\r\n  * Improved **`TextVectorization`** layer, which handles string tokenization, n-gram generation, and token encoding\r\n    * The `TextVectorization` layer now accounts for the mask_token as part of the vocabulary size when output_mode='int'. This means that, if you have a max_tokens value of 5000, your output will have 5000 unique values (not 5001 as before).\r\n    * Change the return value of `TextVectorization.get_vocabulary()` from `byte` to `string`. Users who previously were calling 'decode' on the output of this method should no longer need to do so.\r\n  * Introduce new Keras dataset generation utilities :\r\n    * **[`image_dataset_from_directory`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/preprocessing/image_dataset_from_directory)** is a utility based on `tf.data.Dataset`, meant to replace the legacy `ImageDataGenerator`. It takes you from a structured directory of images to a labeled dataset, in one function call. Note that it doesn't perform image data augmentation (which is meant to be done using preprocessing layers).\r\n    * **[`text_dataset_from_directory`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/preprocessing/text_dataset_from_directory)** takes you from a structured directory of text files to a labeled dataset, in one function call.\r\n    * **[`timeseries_dataset_from_array`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/preprocessing/timeseries_dataset_from_array)** is a `tf.data.Dataset`-based replacement of the legacy `TimeseriesGenerator`. It takes you from an array of timeseries data to a dataset of shifting windows with their targets.\r\n  * Added [`experimental_steps_per_execution`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/Model?version=nightly#compile)\r\n arg to `model.compile` to indicate the number of batches to run per `tf.function` call. This can speed up Keras Models on TPUs up to 3x.\r\n  * Functional models now get constructed if *any* tensor in a layer call's arguments/keyword arguments comes from a keras input. Previously the functional api would only work if all of the elements in the first argument to the layer came from a keras input.\r\n  * Clean up `BatchNormalization` layer's `trainable` property to act like standard python state when it's used inside `tf.functions` (frozen at tracing time), instead of acting like a pseudo-variable whose updates *kind of sometimes* get reflected in already-traced `tf.function` traces.\r\n  * Add the `Conv1DTranspose` layer.\r\n  * Fix bug in `SensitivitySpecificityBase` derived metrics.\r\n  * Blacklist Case op from callback\r\n\r\n### `tf.lite`:\r\n  * Converter\r\n      * Restored `inference_input_type` and `inference_output_type` flags in TF 2.x TFLiteConverter (backward compatible with TF 1.x) to support integer (tf.int8, tf.uint8) input and output types in post training full integer quantized models.\r\n      * Added support for converting and resizing models with dynamic (placeholder) dimensions. Previously, there was only limited support for dynamic batch size, and even that did not guarantee that the model could be properly resized at runtime.\r\n  * CPU\r\n      * Fix an issue w/ dynamic weights and `Conv2D` on x86.\r\n      * Add a runtime Android flag for enabling `XNNPACK` for optimized CPU performance.\r\n      * Add a runtime iOS flag for enabling `XNNPACK` for optimized CPU performance.\r\n      * Add a compiler flag to enable building a TFLite library that applies `XNNPACK` delegate automatically when the model has a `fp32` operation.\r\n  * GPU\r\n      * Allow GPU acceleration starting with internal graph nodes\r\n      * Experimental support for quantized models with the Android GPU delegate\r\n      * Add GPU delegate whitelist.\r\n      * Rename GPU whitelist -> compatibility (list).\r\n      * Improve GPU compatibility list entries from crash reports. \r\n  * NNAPI\r\n      * Set default value for `StatefulNnApiDelegate::Options::max_number_delegated_partitions` to 3.\r\n      * Add capability to disable `NNAPI` CPU and check `NNAPI` Errno.\r\n      * Fix crashes when using `NNAPI` with target accelerator specified with model containing Conv2d or FullyConnected or LSTM nodes with quantized weights.\r\n      * Fix `ANEURALNETWORKS_BAD_DATA` execution failures with `sum`/`max`/`min`/`reduce` operations with `scalar` inputs.\r\n  * Hexagon\r\n      * TFLite Hexagon Delegate out of experimental.\r\n      * Experimental `int8` support for most hexagon ops.\r\n      * Experimental per-channel quant support for `conv` in Hexagon delegate.\r\n      * Support dynamic batch size in C++ API.\r\n  * CoreML\r\n     * Opensource CoreML delegate\r\n  * Misc\r\n      * Enable building Android TFLite targets on Windows\r\n      * Add support for `BatchMatMul`.\r\n      * Add support for `half_pixel_centers` with `ResizeNearestNeighbor`.\r\n      * Add 3D support for `BatchToSpaceND`.\r\n      * Add 5D support for `BroadcastSub`, `Maximum`, `Minimum`, `Transpose` and `BroadcastDiv`.\r\n      * Rename `kTfLiteActRelu1` to `kTfLiteActReluN1To1`.\r\n      * Enable flex delegate on tensorflow.lite.Interpreter Python package.\r\n      * Add `Buckettize`, `SparseCross` and `BoostedTreesBucketize` to the flex whitelist.\r\n      * Add support for selective registration of flex ops.\r\n      * Add missing kernels for flex delegate whitelisted ops.\r\n      * Fix issue when using direct `ByteBuffer` inputs with graphs that have dynamic shapes.\r\n      * Fix error checking supported operations in a model containing `HardSwish`.  \r\n \r\n### TPU Enhancements\r\n  * 3D mesh support\r\n  * Added TPU code for `FTRL` with `multiply_linear_by_lr`.\r\n  * Silently adds a new file system registry at `gstpu`.\r\n  * Support `restartType` in cloud tpu client.\r\n  * Depend on a specific version of google-api-python-client.\r\n  * Fixes apiclient import.\r\n\r\n### XLA Support\r\n  * Implement stable `argmin` and `argmax`\r\n\r\n### Tracing and Debugging\r\n  * Add a `TFE_Py_Execute` traceme.    \r\n  \r\n## Thanks to our Contributors\r\n\r\nThis release contains contributions from many people at Google, as well as:\r\n902449@58880@bigcat_chen@ASIC, Abdul Baseer Khan, Abhineet Choudhary, Abolfazl Shahbazi, Adam Hillier, ag.ramesh, Agoniii, Ajay P, Alex Hoffman, Alexander Bayandin, Alexander Grund, Alexandre Abadie, Alexey Rogachevskiy, amoitra, Andrew Stevens, Angus-Luo, Anshuman Tripathy, Anush Elangovan, Artem Mavrin, Ashutosh Hathidara, autoih, Ayushman Kumar, ayushmankumar7, Bairen Yi, Bas Aarts, Bastian Eichenberger, Ben Barsdell, bhack, Bharat Raghunathan, Biagio Montaruli, Bigcat-Himax, blueyi, Bryan Cutler, Byambaa, Carlos Hernandez-Vaquero, Chen Lei, Chris Knorowski, Christian Clauss, chuanqiw, CuiYifeng, Daniel Situnayake, Daria Zhuravleva, Dayananda-V, Deven Desai, Devi Sandeep Endluri, Dmitry Zakharov, Dominic Jack, Duncan Riach, Edgar Liberis, Ehsan Toosi, ekuznetsov139, Elena Zhelezina, Eugene Kuznetsov, Eugene Mikhantiev, Evgenii Zheltonozhskii, Fabio Di Domenico, Fausto Morales, Fei Sun, feihugis, Felix E.

Because all images now use Python 3, Docker tags containing `-py3` will no longer be provided and existing `-py3` tags like `latest-py3` will not be updated.   \r\n\r\n## Major Features and Improvements\r\n\r\n* Replaced the scalar type for string tensors from `std::string` to `tensorflow::tstring` which is now ABI stable.\r\n* A new Profiler for TF 2 for CPU/GPU/TPU. It offers both device and host performance analysis, including input pipeline and TF Ops. Optimization advisory is provided whenever possible. Please see [this tutorial](https://www.tensorflow.org/tensorboard/tensorboard_profiling_keras) and [guide](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/profiler) for usage guidelines.\r\n* Export C++ functions to Python using `pybind11` as opposed to `SWIG` as a part of our [deprecation of swig efforts](https://github.com/tensorflow/community/blob/master/rfcs/20190208-pybind11.md).\r\n* `tf.distribute`:\r\n  * Support added for global sync `BatchNormalization` by using the newly added `tf.keras.layers.experimental.SyncBatchNormalization` layer. This layer will sync `BatchNormalization` statistics every step across all replicas taking part in sync training.\r\n  * Performance improvements for GPU multi-worker distributed training using `tf.distribute.experimental.MultiWorkerMirroredStrategy`\r\n    * Update NVIDIA `NCCL` to `2.5.7-1` for better performance and performance tuning. Please see [nccl developer guide](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/sdk/nccl-developer-guide/docs/env.html) for more information on this.\r\n    * Support gradient `allreduce` in `float16`. See this [example](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/official/staging/training/grad_utils.py) usage.\r\n    * Experimental support of [all reduce gradient packing](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/distribute/experimental/CollectiveHints) to allow overlapping gradient aggregation with backward path computation. \r\n    * Deprecated `experimental_run_v2` method for distribution strategies and renamed the method `run` as it is no longer experimental.\r\n    * Add CompositeTensor support for DistributedIterators. This should help prevent unnecessary function retracing and memory leaks.\r\n* `tf.keras`:\r\n  * `Model.fit` major improvements:\r\n     * You can now use custom training logic with `Model.fit` by overriding `Model.train_step`.\r\n     * Easily write state-of-the-art training loops without worrying about all of the features `Model.fit` handles for you (distribution strategies, callbacks, data formats, looping logic, etc)\r\n     * See the default [`Model.train_step`](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/1381fc8e15e22402417b98e3881dfd409998daea/tensorflow/python/keras/engine/training.py#L540) for an example of what this function should look like. Same applies for validation and inference via `Model.test_step` and `Model.predict_step`.\r\n     * SavedModel uses its own `Model._saved_model_inputs_spec` attr now instead of\r\n       relying on `Model.inputs` and `Model.input_names`, which are no longer set for subclass Models. \r\n       This attr is set in eager, `tf.function`, and graph modes. This gets rid of the need for users to \r\n       manually call `Model._set_inputs` when using Custom Training Loops(CTLs).\r\n     * Dynamic shapes are supported for generators by calling the Model on the first batch we \"peek\" from the generator. \r\n       This used to happen implicitly in `Model._standardize_user_data`. Long-term, a solution where the \r\n       `DataAdapter` doesn't need to call the Model is probably preferable.\r\n  * The SavedModel format now supports all Keras built-in layers (including metrics, preprocessing layers, and stateful RNN layers)\r\n  * Update Keras batch normalization layer to use the running mean and average computation in the `fused_batch_norm`. You should see significant performance improvements when using `fused_batch_norm` in Eager mode.\r\n\r\n* `tf.lite`:\r\n  * Enable TFLite experimental new converter by default.\r\n* XLA\r\n  * XLA now builds and works on windows. All prebuilt packages come with XLA available.\r\n  * XLA can be [enabled for a `tf.function`](https://www.tensorflow.org/xla#explicit_compilation_with_tffunction\r\n) with “compile or throw exception” semantics on CPU and GPU.\r\n\r\n## Breaking Changes\r\n* `tf.keras`: \r\n  * In `tf.keras.applications` the name of the \"top\" layer has been standardized to \"predictions\". This is only a problem if your code relies on the exact name of the layer.\r\n  * Huber loss function has been updated to be consistent with other Keras losses. It now computes mean over the last axis of per-sample losses before applying the reduction function.\r\n* AutoGraph no longer converts functions passed to `tf.py_function`, `tf.py_func` and `tf.numpy_function`.\r\n* Deprecating `XLA_CPU` and `XLA_GPU` devices with this release.\r\n* Increasing the minimum bazel version to build TF to 2.0.0 to use Bazel's `cc_experimental_shared_library`.\r\n* Keras compile/fit behavior for functional and subclassed models have been unified. Model properties such as `metrics`, `metrics_names` will now be available only after **training/evaluating the model on actual data** for functional models. `metrics` will **now include** model `loss` and output losses.`loss_functions` property has been removed from the model. This was an undocumented property that was accidentally public and has now been removed.\r\n\r\n## Known Caveats\r\n* The current TensorFlow release now **requires** [gast](https://pypi.org/project/gast/) version 0.3.3. \r\n\r\n## Bug Fixes and Other Changes\r\n* `tf.data`:\r\n  * Removed `autotune_algorithm` from experimental optimization options.\r\n* TF Core:\r\n  * `tf.constant` always creates CPU tensors irrespective of the current device context.  \r\n  * Eager `TensorHandles` maintain a list of mirrors for any copies to local or remote devices. This avoids any redundant copies due to op execution.\r\n  * For `tf.Tensor` & `tf.Variable`, `.experimental_ref()` is no longer experimental and is available as simply `.ref()`.\r\n  * `pfor/vectorized_map`: Added support for vectorizing 56 more ops. Vectorizing `tf.cond` is also supported now.\r\n  * Set as much partial shape as we can infer statically within the gradient impl of the gather op.\r\n  * Gradient of `tf.while_loop` emits `StatelessWhile` op if `cond` and body functions are stateless. This allows multiple gradients while ops to run in parallel under distribution strategy.\r\n  * Speed up `GradientTape` in eager mode by auto-generating list of op inputs/outputs which are unused and hence not cached for gradient functions.\r\n  * Support `back_prop=False` in `while_v2` but mark it as deprecated.\r\n  * Improve error message when attempting to use `None` in data-dependent control flow.\r\n  * Add `RaggedTensor.numpy()`.\r\n  * Update `RaggedTensor.__getitem__` to preserve uniform dimensions & allow indexing into uniform dimensions.\r\n  * Update `tf.expand_dims` to always insert the new dimension as a non-ragged dimension.\r\n  * Update `tf.embedding_lookup` to use `partition_strategy` and `max_norm` when `ids` is ragged.\r\n  * Allow `batch_dims==rank(indices)` in `tf.gather`.\r\n  * Add support for bfloat16 in `tf.print`.  \r\n* `tf.distribute`: \r\n  * Support `embedding_column` with variable-length input features for `MultiWorkerMirroredStrategy`.\r\n* `tf.keras`:\r\n  * Added `experimental_aggregate_gradients` argument to `tf.keras.optimizer.Optimizer.apply_gradients`. This allows custom gradient aggregation and processing aggregated gradients in custom training loop.\r\n  * Allow `pathlib.Path` paths for loading models via Keras API.\r\n* `tf.function`/AutoGraph:\r\n  * AutoGraph is now available in `ReplicaContext.merge_call`, `Strategy.extended.update` and `Strategy.extended.update_non_slot`.\r\n  * Experimental support for shape invariants has been enabled in `tf.function`. See the API docs for `tf.autograph.experimental.set_loop_options` for additonal info.\r\n  * AutoGraph error messages now exclude frames corresponding to APIs internal to AutoGraph.\r\n  * Improve shape inference for `tf.function` input arguments to unlock more Grappler optimizations in TensorFlow 2.x.\r\n  * Improve automatic control dependency management of resources by allowing resource reads to occur in parallel and synchronizing only on writes.\r\n  * Fix execution order of multiple stateful calls to `experimental_run_v2` in `tf.function`.\r\n  * You can now iterate over `RaggedTensors` using a for loop inside `tf.function`.\r\n* `tf.lite`:\r\n  *  Migrated the `tf.lite` C inference API out of experimental into lite/c.\r\n  * Add an option to disallow `NNAPI` CPU / partial acceleration on Android 10\r\n  * TFLite Android AARs now include the C headers and APIs are required to use TFLite from native code.\r\n  * Refactors the delegate and delegate kernel sources to allow usage in the linter.\r\n  * Limit delegated ops to actually supported ones if a device name is specified or `NNAPI` CPU Fallback is disabled.\r\n  * TFLite now supports `tf.math.reciprocal1` op by lowering to `tf.div op`.\r\n  * TFLite's unpack op now supports boolean tensor inputs.\r\n  * Microcontroller and embedded code moved from experimental to main TensorFlow Lite folder\r\n  * Check for large TFLite tensors.\r\n  * Fix GPU delegate crash with C++17.\r\n  * Add 5D support to TFLite `strided_slice`.\r\n  * Fix error in delegation of `DEPTH_TO_SPACE` to `NNAPI` causing op not to be accelerated.\r\n  * Fix segmentation fault when running a model with LSTM nodes using `NNAPI` Delegate\r\n  * Fix `NNAPI` delegate failure when an operand for Maximum/Minimum operation is a scalar.\r\n  * Fix `NNAPI` delegate failure when Axis input for reduce operation is a scalar.\r\n  * Expose option to limit the number of partitions that will be delegated to `NNAPI`.\r\n  * If a target accelerator is specified, use its feature level to determine operations to delegate instead of SDK version.\r\n* `tf.random`:\r\n  * Various random number generation improvements: \r\n    * Add a fast path for default `random_uniform`\r\n    * `random_seed` documentation improvement.\r\n    * `RandomBinomial` broadcasts and appends the sample shape to the left rather than the right. \r\n  * Added `tf.random.stateless_binomial`, `tf.random.stateless_gamma`, `tf.random.stateless_poisson`\r\n  * `tf.random.stateless_uniform` now supports unbounded sampling of `int` types.\r\n* Math and Linear Algebra:\r\n  * Add `tf.linalg.LinearOperatorTridiag`.\r\n  * Add `LinearOperatorBlockLowerTriangular`\r\n  * Add broadcasting support to tf.linalg.triangular_solve[#26204](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/26204), tf.math.invert_permutation.\r\n  * Add `tf.math.sobol_sample` op.\r\n  * Add `tf.math.xlog1py`.\r\n  * Add `tf.math.special.{dawsn,expi,fresnel_cos,fresnel_sin,spence}`.\r\n  * Add a Modified Discrete Cosine Transform (MDCT) and its inverse to `tf.signal`.\r\n* TPU Enhancements:\r\n  * Refactor `TpuClusterResolver` to move shared logic to a separate pip package.\r\n  * Support configuring TPU software version from cloud tpu client.\r\n  * Allowed TPU embedding weight decay factor to be multiplied by learning rate.\r\n* XLA Support:\r\n  * Add standalone XLA AOT runtime target + relevant .cc sources to pip package.\r\n  * Add check for memory alignment to MemoryAllocation::MemoryAllocation() on 32-bit ARM. This ensures a deterministic early exit instead of a hard to debug bus error later.\r\n  * `saved_model_cli aot_compile_cpu` allows you to compile saved models to XLA header+object files and include them in your C++ programs.\r\n  * Enable `Igamma`, `Igammac` for XLA.\r\n* Deterministic Op Functionality:\r\n  * XLA reduction emitter is deterministic when the environment variable `TF_DETERMINISTIC_OPS` is set to \"true\" or \"1\". This extends deterministic `tf.nn.bias_add` back-prop functionality (and therefore also deterministic back-prop of bias-addition in Keras layers) to include when XLA JIT complilation is enabled.\r\n  * Fix problem, when running on a CUDA GPU and when either environment variable `TF_DETERMINSTIC_OPS` or environment variable `TF_CUDNN_DETERMINISTIC` is set to \"true\" or \"1\", in which some layer configurations led to an exception with the message \"No algorithm worked!\"\r\n* Tracing and Debugging:\r\n  * Add source, destination name to `_send` traceme to allow easier debugging.\r\n  * Add traceme event to `fastpathexecute`.\r\n* Other:\r\n  * Fix an issue with AUC.reset_states for multi-label AUC [#35852](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/35852)\r\n  * Fix the TF upgrade script to not delete files when there is a parsing error and the output mode is `in-place`.\r\n  * Move `tensorflow/core:framework/*_pyclif` rules to `tensorflow/core/framework:*_pyclif`.\r\n\r\n## Thanks to our Contributors\r\n\r\nThis release contains contributions from many people at Google, as well as:\r\n\r\n372046933, 8bitmp3, aaronhma, Abin Shahab, Aditya Patwardhan, Agoniii, Ahti Kitsik, Alan Yee, Albin Joy, Alex Hoffman, Alexander Grund, Alexandre E.

This allows custom gradient aggregation and processing aggregated gradients in custom training loop.\r\n  * Allow `pathlib.Path` paths for loading models via Keras API.\r\n* `tf.function`/AutoGraph:\r\n  * AutoGraph is now available in `ReplicaContext.merge_call`, `Strategy.extended.update` and `Strategy.extended.update_non_slot`.\r\n  * Experimental support for shape invariants has been enabled in `tf.function`.

    "body": "# Release 2.2.0\r\n\r\n## Major Features and Improvements\r\n\r\n* Replaced the scalar type for string tensors from `std::string` to `tensorflow::tstring` which is now ABI stable.\r\n* A new Profiler for TF 2 for CPU/GPU/TPU. It offers both device and host performance analysis, including input pipeline and TF Ops. Optimization advisory is provided whenever possible. Please see [this tutorial](https://www.tensorflow.org/tensorboard/tensorboard_profiling_keras) and [guide](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/profiler) for usage guidelines.\r\n* Export C++ functions to Python using `pybind11` as opposed to `SWIG` as a part of our [deprecation of swig efforts](https://github.com/tensorflow/community/blob/master/rfcs/20190208-pybind11.md).\r\n* `tf.distribute`:\r\n  * Support added for global sync `BatchNormalization` by using the newly added `tf.keras.layers.experimental.SyncBatchNormalization` layer. This layer will sync `BatchNormalization` statistics every step across all replicas taking part in sync training.\r\n  * Performance improvements for GPU multi-worker distributed training using `tf.distribute.experimental.MultiWorkerMirroredStrategy`\r\n    * Update NVIDIA `NCCL` to `2.5.7-1` for better performance and performance tuning. Please see [nccl developer guide](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/sdk/nccl-developer-guide/docs/env.html) for more information on this.\r\n    * Support gradient `allreduce` in `float16`. See this [example](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/official/staging/training/grad_utils.py) usage.\r\n    * Experimental support of [all reduce gradient packing](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/distribute/experimental/CollectiveHints) to allow overlapping gradient aggregation with backward path computation. \r\n    * Deprecated `experimental_run_v2` method for distribution strategies and renamed the method `run` as it is no longer experimental.\r\n* `tf.keras`:\r\n  * `Model.fit` major improvements:\r\n     * You can now use custom training logic with `Model.fit` by overriding `Model.train_step`.\r\n     * Easily write state-of-the-art training loops without worrying about all of the features `Model.fit` handles for you (distribution strategies, callbacks, data formats, looping logic, etc)\r\n     * See the default [`Model.train_step`](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/1381fc8e15e22402417b98e3881dfd409998daea/tensorflow/python/keras/engine/training.py#L540) for an example of what this function should look like. Same applies for validation and inference via `Model.test_step` and `Model.predict_step`.\r\n     * SavedModel uses its own `Model._saved_model_inputs_spec` attr now instead of\r\n       relying on `Model.inputs` and `Model.input_names`, which are no longer set for subclass Models. \r\n       This attr is set in eager, `tf.function`, and graph modes. This gets rid of the need for users to \r\n       manually call `Model._set_inputs` when using Custom Training Loops(CTLs).\r\n     * Dynamic shapes are supported for generators by calling the Model on the first batch we \"peek\" from the generator. \r\n       This used to happen implicitly in `Model._standardize_user_data`. Long-term, a solution where the \r\n       `DataAdapter` doesn't need to call the Model is probably preferable.\r\n  * The SavedModel format now supports all Keras built-in layers (including metrics, preprocessing layers, and stateful RNN layers)\r\n  * Update Keras batch normalization layer to use the running mean and average computation in the `fused_batch_norm`. You should see significant performance improvements when using `fused_batch_norm` in Eager mode.\r\n\r\n* `tf.lite`:\r\n  * Enable TFLite experimental new converter by default.\r\n* XLA\r\n  * XLA now builds and works on windows. All prebuilt packages come with XLA available.\r\n  * XLA can be [enabled for a `tf.function`](https://www.tensorflow.org/xla#explicit_compilation_with_tffunction\r\n) with “compile or throw exception” semantics on CPU and GPU.\r\n\r\n## Breaking Changes\r\n* `tf.keras`: \r\n  * In `tf.keras.applications` the name of the \"top\" layer has been standardized to \"predictions\". This is only a problem if your code relies on the exact name of the layer.\r\n  * Huber loss function has been updated to be consistent with other Keras losses. It now computes mean over the last axis of per-sample losses before applying the reduction function.\r\n* AutoGraph no longer converts functions passed to `tf.py_function`, `tf.py_func` and `tf.numpy_function`.\r\n* Deprecating `XLA_CPU` and `XLA_GPU` devices with this release.\r\n* Increasing the minimum bazel version to build TF to 2.0.0 to use Bazel's `cc_experimental_shared_library`.\r\n* Keras compile/fit behavior for functional and subclassed models have been unified. Model properties such as `metrics`, `metrics_names` will now be available only after **training/evaluating the model on actual data** for functional models. `metrics` will **now include** model `loss` and output losses.`loss_functions` property has been removed from the model. This was an undocumented property that was accidentally public and has now been removed.\r\n\r\n## Known Caveats\r\n* Due to certain unforeseen circumstances, we are unable to release MacOS py3.8 binaries, but Windows/Linux binaries for py3.8 are available.\r\n* The current TensorFlow release now **requires** [gast](https://pypi.org/project/gast/) version 0.3.3. \r\n\r\n## Bug Fixes and Other Changes\r\n* `tf.data`:\r\n  * Removed `autotune_algorithm` from experimental optimization options.\r\n* TF Core:\r\n  * `tf.constant` always creates CPU tensors irrespective of the current device context.  \r\n  * Eager `TensorHandles` maintain a list of mirrors for any copies to local or remote devices. This avoids any redundant copies due to op execution.\r\n  * For `tf.Tensor` & `tf.Variable`, `.experimental_ref()` is no longer experimental and is available as simply `.ref()`.\r\n  * `pfor/vectorized_map`: Added support for vectorizing 56 more ops. Vectorizing `tf.cond` is also supported now.\r\n  * Set as much partial shape as we can infer statically within the gradient impl of the gather op.\r\n  * Gradient of `tf.while_loop` emits `StatelessWhile` op if `cond` and body functions are stateless. This allows multiple gradients while ops to run in parallel under distribution strategy.\r\n  * Speed up `GradientTape` in eager mode by auto-generating list of op inputs/outputs which are unused and hence not cached for gradient functions.\r\n  * Support `back_prop=False` in `while_v2` but mark it as deprecated.\r\n  * Improve error message when attempting to use `None` in data-dependent control flow.\r\n  * Add `RaggedTensor.numpy()`.\r\n  * Update `RaggedTensor.__getitem__` to preserve uniform dimensions & allow indexing into uniform dimensions.\r\n  * Update `tf.expand_dims` to always insert the new dimension as a non-ragged dimension.\r\n  * Update `tf.embedding_lookup` to use `partition_strategy` and `max_norm` when `ids` is ragged.\r\n  * Allow `batch_dims==rank(indices)` in `tf.gather`.\r\n  * Add support for bfloat16 in `tf.print`.  \r\n* `tf.distribute`: \r\n  * Support `embedding_column` with variable-length input features for `MultiWorkerMirroredStrategy`.\r\n* `tf.keras`:\r\n  * Added `experimental_aggregate_gradients` argument to `tf.keras.optimizer.Optimizer.apply_gradients`. This allows custom gradient aggregation and processing aggregated gradients in custom training loop.\r\n  * Allow `pathlib.Path` paths for loading models via Keras API.\r\n* `tf.function`/AutoGraph:\r\n  * AutoGraph is now available in `ReplicaContext.merge_call`, `Strategy.extended.update` and `Strategy.extended.update_non_slot`.\r\n  * Experimental support for shape invariants has been enabled in `tf.function`.

    "body": "# Release 2.2.0\r\n\r\n## Major Features and Improvements\r\n\r\n* Replaced the scalar type for string tensors from `std::string` to `tensorflow::tstring` which is now ABI stable.\r\n* A new Profiler for TF 2 for CPU/GPU/TPU. It offers both device and host performance analysis, including input pipeline and TF Ops. Optimization advisory is provided whenever possible. Please see [this tutorial](https://www.tensorflow.org/tensorboard/tensorboard_profiling_keras) and [guide](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/profiler) for usage guidelines.\r\n* Export C++ functions to Python using `pybind11` as opposed to `SWIG` as a part of our [deprecation of swig efforts](https://github.com/tensorflow/community/blob/master/rfcs/20190208-pybind11.md).\r\n* `tf.distribute`:\r\n  * Support added for global sync `BatchNormalization` by using the newly added `tf.keras.layers.experimental.SyncBatchNormalization` layer. This layer will sync `BatchNormalization` statistics every step across all replicas taking part in sync training.\r\n  * Performance improvements for GPU multi-worker distributed training using `tf.distribute.experimental.MultiWorkerMirroredStrategy`\r\n    * Update NVIDIA `NCCL` to `2.5.7-1` for better performance and performance tuning. Please see [nccl developer guide](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/sdk/nccl-developer-guide/docs/env.html) for more information on this.\r\n    * Support gradient `allreduce` in `float16`. See this [example](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/official/staging/training/grad_utils.py) usage.\r\n    * Experimental support of [all reduce gradient packing](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/distribute/experimental/CollectiveHints) to allow overlapping gradient aggregation with backward path computation. \r\n    * Deprecated `experimental_run_v2` method for distribution strategies and renamed the method `run` as it is no longer experimental.\r\n* `tf.keras`:\r\n  * `Model.fit` major improvements:\r\n     * You can now use custom training logic with `Model.fit` by overriding `Model.train_step`.\r\n     * Easily write state-of-the-art training loops without worrying about all of the features `Model.fit` handles for you (distribution strategies, callbacks, data formats, looping logic, etc)\r\n     * See the default [`Model.train_step`](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/python/keras/engine/training.py#L433) for an example of what this function should look like\r\n     * Same applies for validation and inference via `Model.test_step` and `Model.predict_step`\r\n  * The SavedModel format now supports all Keras built-in layers (including metrics, preprocessing layers, and stateful RNN layers)\r\n* `tf.lite`:\r\n  * Enable TFLite experimental new converter by default.\r\n* XLA\r\n  * XLA now builds and works on windows. All prebuilt packages come with XLA available.\r\n  * XLA can be [enabled for a `tf.function`](https://www.tensorflow.org/xla#explicit_compilation_with_tffunction\r\n) with “compile or throw exception” semantics on CPU and GPU.\r\n\r\n## Breaking Changes\r\n* `tf.keras`: \r\n  * In `tf.keras.applications` the name of the \"top\" layer has been standardized to \"predictions\". This is only a problem if your code relies on the exact name of the layer.\r\n  * Huber loss function has been updated to be consistent with other Keras losses. It now computes mean over the last axis of per-sample losses before applying the reduction function.\r\n* AutoGraph no longer converts functions passed to `tf.py_function`, `tf.py_func` and `tf.numpy_function`.\r\n* Deprecating `XLA_CPU` and `XLA_GPU` devices with this release.\r\n* Increasing the minimum bazel version to build TF to 2.0.0 to use Bazel's `cc_experimental_shared_library`.\r\n\r\n## Known Caveats\r\n* Due to certain unforeseen circumstances, we are unable to release MacOS py3.8 binaries, but Windows/Linux binaries for py3.8 are available.\r\n* The current TensorFlow release now **requires** gast version 0.3.3. \r\n\r\n## Bug Fixes and Other Changes\r\n* `tf.data`:\r\n  * Removed `autotune_algorithm` from experimental optimization options.\r\n* TF Core:\r\n  * `tf.constant` always creates CPU tensors irrespective of the current device context.  \r\n  * Eager `TensorHandles` maintain a list of mirrors for any copies to local or remote devices. This avoids any redundant copies due to op execution.\r\n  * For `tf.Tensor` & `tf.Variable`, `.experimental_ref()` is no longer experimental and is available as simply `.ref()`.\r\n  * `pfor/vectorized_map`: Added support for vectorizing 56 more ops. Vectorizing `tf.cond` is also supported now.\r\n  * Set as much partial shape as we can infer statically within the gradient impl of the gather op.\r\n  * Gradient of `tf.while_loop` emits `StatelessWhile` op if `cond` and body functions are stateless. This allows multiple gradients while ops to run in parallel under distribution strategy.\r\n  * Speed up `GradientTape` in eager mode by auto-generating list of op inputs/outputs which are unused and hence not cached for gradient functions.\r\n  * Support `back_prop=False` in `while_v2` but mark it as deprecated.\r\n  * Improve error message when attempting to use `None` in data-dependent control flow.\r\n  * Add `RaggedTensor.numpy()`.\r\n  * Update `RaggedTensor.__getitem__` to preserve uniform dimensions & allow indexing into uniform dimensions.\r\n  * Update `tf.expand_dims` to always insert the new dimension as a non-ragged dimension.\r\n  * Update `tf.embedding_lookup` to use `partition_strategy` and `max_norm` when `ids` is ragged.\r\n  * Allow `batch_dims==rank(indices)` in `tf.gather`.\r\n  * Add support for bfloat16 in `tf.print`.  \r\n* `tf.distribute`: \r\n  * Support `embedding_column` with variable-length input features for `MultiWorkerMirroredStrategy`.\r\n* `tf.keras`:\r\n  * Added `all_reduce_sum_gradients` argument to `tf.keras.optimizer.Optimizer.apply_gradients`. This allows custom gradient aggregation and processing aggregated gradients in custom training loop.\r\n  * Allow `pathlib.Path` paths for loading models via Keras API.\r\n* `tf.function`/AutoGraph:\r\n  * AutoGraph is now available in `ReplicaContext.merge_call`, `Strategy.extended.update` and `Strategy.extended.update_non_slot`.\r\n  * Experimental support for shape invariants has been enabled in `tf.function`. See the API docs for `tf.autograph.experimental.set_loop_options` for additonal info.\r\n  * AutoGraph error messages now exclude frames corresponding to APIs internal to AutoGraph.\r\n  * Improve shape inference for `tf.function` input arguments to unlock more Grappler optimizations in TensorFlow 2.x.\r\n  * Improve automatic control dependency management of resources by allowing resource reads to occur in parallel and synchronizing only on writes.\r\n  * Fix execution order of multiple stateful calls to `experimental_run_v2` in `tf.function`.\r\n  * You can now iterate over `RaggedTensors` using a for loop inside `tf.function`.\r\n* `tf.lite`:\r\n  *  Migrated the `tf.lite` C inference API out of experimental into lite/c.\r\n  * Add an option to disallow `NNAPI` CPU / partial acceleration on Android 10\r\n  * TFLite Android AARs now include the C headers and APIs are required to use TFLite from native code.\r\n  * Refactors the delegate and delegate kernel sources to allow usage in the linter.\r\n  * Limit delegated ops to actually supported ones if a device name is specified or `NNAPI` CPU Fallback is disabled.\r\n  * TFLite now supports `tf.math.reciprocal1` op by lowering to `tf.div op`.\r\n  * TFLite's unpack op now supports boolean tensor inputs.\r\n  * Microcontroller and embedded code moved from experimental to main TensorFlow Lite folder\r\n  * Check for large TFLite tensors.\r\n  * Fix GPU delegate crash with C++17.\r\n  * Add 5D support to TFLite `strided_slice`.\r\n  * Fix error in delegation of `DEPTH_TO_SPACE` to `NNAPI` causing op not to be accelerated.\r\n  * Fix segmentation fault when running a model with LSTM nodes using `NNAPI` Delegate\r\n  * Fix `NNAPI` delegate failure when an operand for Maximum/Minimum operation is a scalar.\r\n  * Fix `NNAPI` delegate failure when Axis input for reduce operation is a scalar.\r\n  * Expose option to limit the number of partitions that will be delegated to `NNAPI`.\r\n  * If a target accelerator is specified, use its feature level to determine operations to delegate instead of SDK version.\r\n* `tf.random`:\r\n  * Various random number generation improvements: \r\n    * Add a fast path for default `random_uniform`\r\n    * `random_seed` documentation improvement.\r\n    * `RandomBinomial` broadcasts and appends the sample shape to the left rather than the right. \r\n  * Added `tf.random.stateless_binomial`, `tf.random.stateless_gamma`, `tf.random.stateless_poisson`\r\n  * `tf.random.stateless_uniform` now supports unbounded sampling of `int` types.\r\n* Math and Linear Algebra:\r\n  * Add `tf.linalg.LinearOperatorTridiag`.\r\n  * Add `LinearOperatorBlockLowerTriangular`\r\n  * Add broadcasting support to tf.linalg.triangular_solve[#26204](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/26204), tf.math.invert_permutation.\r\n  * Add `tf.math.sobol_sample` op.\r\n  * Add `tf.math.xlog1py`.\r\n  * Add `tf.math.special.{dawsn,expi,fresnel_cos,fresnel_sin,spence}`.\r\n  * Add a Modified Discrete Cosine Transform (MDCT) and its inverse to `tf.signal`.\r\n* TPU Enhancements:\r\n  * Refactor `TpuClusterResolver` to move shared logic to a separate pip package.\r\n  * Support configuring TPU software version from cloud tpu client.\r\n  * Allowed TPU embedding weight decay factor to be multiplied by learning rate.\r\n* XLA Support:\r\n  * Add standalone XLA AOT runtime target + relevant .cc sources to pip package.\r\n  * Add check for memory alignment to MemoryAllocation::MemoryAllocation() on 32-bit ARM.

    "body": "# Release 2.2.0\r\n\r\n## Major Features and Improvements\r\n\r\n* Replaced the scalar type for string tensors from `std::string` to `tensorflow::tstring` which is now ABI stable.\r\n* A new Profiler for TF 2 for CPU/GPU/TPU. It offers both device and host performance analysis, including input pipeline and TF Ops. Optimization advisory is provided whenever possible. Please see [this tutorial](https://www.tensorflow.org/tensorboard/tensorboard_profiling_keras) and [guide](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/profiler) for usage guidelines.\r\n* Export C++ functions to Python using `pybind11` as opposed to `SWIG` as a part of our [deprecation of swig efforts](https://github.com/tensorflow/community/blob/master/rfcs/20190208-pybind11.md).\r\n* `tf.distribute`:\r\n  * Support added for global sync `BatchNormalization` by using the newly added `tf.keras.layers.experimental.SyncBatchNormalization` layer. This layer will sync `BatchNormalization` statistics every step across all replicas taking part in sync training.\r\n  * Performance improvements for GPU multi-worker distributed training using `tf.distribute.experimental.MultiWorkerMirroredStrategy`\r\n    * Update NVIDIA `NCCL` to `2.5.7-1` for better performance and performance tuning. Please see [nccl developer guide](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/sdk/nccl-developer-guide/docs/env.html) for more information on this.\r\n    * Support gradient `allreduce` in `float16`. See this [example](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/official/staging/training/grad_utils.py) usage.\r\n    * Experimental support of [all reduce gradient packing](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/distribute/experimental/CollectiveHints) to allow overlapping gradient aggregation with backward path computation. \r\n* `tf.keras`:\r\n  * `Model.fit` major improvements:\r\n     * You can now use custom training logic with `Model.fit` by overriding `Model.train_step`.\r\n     * Easily write state-of-the-art training loops without worrying about all of the features `Model.fit` handles for you (distribution strategies, callbacks, data formats, looping logic, etc)\r\n     * See the default [`Model.train_step`](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/python/keras/engine/training.py#L433) for an example of what this function should look like\r\n     * Same applies for validation and inference via `Model.test_step` and `Model.predict_step`\r\n  * The SavedModel format now supports all Keras built-in layers (including metrics, preprocessing layers, and stateful RNN layers)\r\n* `tf.lite`:\r\n  * Enable TFLite experimental new converter by default.\r\n* XLA\r\n  * XLA now builds and works on windows. All prebuilt packages come with XLA available.\r\n  * XLA can be [enabled for a `tf.function`](https://www.tensorflow.org/xla#explicit_compilation_with_tffunction\r\n) with “compile or throw exception” semantics on CPU and GPU.\r\n\r\n## Breaking Changes\r\n* `tf.keras`: \r\n  * In `tf.keras.applications` the name of the \"top\" layer has been standardized to \"predictions\". This is only a problem if your code relies on the exact name of the layer.\r\n  * Huber loss function has been updated to be consistent with other Keras losses. It now computes mean over the last axis of per-sample losses before applying the reduction function.\r\n* AutoGraph no longer converts functions passed to `tf.py_function`, `tf.py_func` and `tf.numpy_function`.\r\n* Deprecating `XLA_CPU` and `XLA_GPU` devices with this release.\r\n* Increasing the minimum bazel version to build TF to 2.0.0 to use Bazel's `cc_experimental_shared_library`.\r\n\r\n## Known Caveats\r\n* MacOS binaries are **not available** on pypi at tensorflow-cpu project, but they are identical to the binaries in [tensorflow project](https://pypi.org/project/tensorflow/2.2.0rc0/#files), since MacOS has no GPU.\r\n* Due to certain unforeseen circumstances, we are unable to release MacOS py3.8 binaries, but Windows/Linux binaries for py3.8 are available.\r\n* The current TensorFlow release now **requires** gast version 0.3.3. \r\n\r\n## Bug Fixes and Other Changes\r\n* `tf.data`:\r\n  * Removed `autotune_algorithm` from experimental optimization options.\r\n* TF Core:\r\n  * `tf.constant` always creates CPU tensors irrespective of the current device context.  \r\n  * Eager `TensorHandles` maintain a list of mirrors for any copies to local or remote devices. This avoids any redundant copies due to op execution.\r\n  * For `tf.Tensor` & `tf.Variable`, `.experimental_ref()` is no longer experimental and is available as simply `.ref()`.\r\n  * `pfor/vectorized_map`: Added support for vectorizing 56 more ops. Vectorizing `tf.cond` is also supported now.\r\n  * Set as much partial shape as we can infer statically within the gradient impl of the gather op.\r\n  * Gradient of `tf.while_loop` emits `StatelessWhile` op if `cond` and body functions are stateless. This allows multiple gradients while ops to run in parallel under distribution strategy.\r\n  * Speed up `GradientTape` in eager mode by auto-generating list of op inputs/outputs which are unused and hence not cached for gradient functions.\r\n  * Support `back_prop=False` in `while_v2` but mark it as deprecated.\r\n  * Improve error message when attempting to use `None` in data-dependent control flow.\r\n  * Add `RaggedTensor.numpy()`.\r\n  * Update `RaggedTensor.__getitem__` to preserve uniform dimensions & allow indexing into uniform dimensions.\r\n  * Update `tf.expand_dims` to always insert the new dimension as a non-ragged dimension.\r\n  * Update `tf.embedding_lookup` to use `partition_strategy` and `max_norm` when `ids` is ragged.\r\n  * Allow `batch_dims==rank(indices)` in `tf.gather`.\r\n  * Add support for bfloat16 in `tf.print`.  \r\n* `tf.distribute`: \r\n  * Support `embedding_column` with variable-length input features for `MultiWorkerMirroredStrategy`.\r\n* `tf.keras`:\r\n  * Added `all_reduce_sum_gradients` argument to `tf.keras.optimizer.Optimizer.apply_gradients`. This allows custom gradient aggregation and processing aggregated gradients in custom training loop.\r\n  * Allow `pathlib.Path` paths for loading models via Keras API.\r\n* `tf.function`/AutoGraph:\r\n  * AutoGraph is now available in `ReplicaContext.merge_call`, `Strategy.extended.update` and `Strategy.extended.update_non_slot`.\r\n  * Experimental support for shape invariants has been enabled in `tf.function`. See the API docs for `tf.autograph.experimental.set_loop_options` for additonal info.\r\n  * AutoGraph error messages now exclude frames corresponding to APIs internal to AutoGraph.\r\n  * Improve shape inference for `tf.function` input arguments to unlock more Grappler optimizations in TensorFlow 2.x.\r\n  * Improve automatic control dependency management of resources by allowing resource reads to occur in parallel and synchronizing only on writes.\r\n  * Fix execution order of multiple stateful calls to `experimental_run_v2` in `tf.function`.\r\n  * You can now iterate over `RaggedTensors` using a for loop inside `tf.function`.\r\n* `tf.lite`:\r\n  *  Migrated the `tf.lite` C inference API out of experimental into lite/c.\r\n  * Add an option to disallow `NNAPI` CPU / partial acceleration on Android 10\r\n  * TFLite Android AARs now include the C headers and APIs are required to use TFLite from native code.\r\n  * Refactors the delegate and delegate kernel sources to allow usage in the linter.\r\n  * Limit delegated ops to actually supported ones if a device name is specified or `NNAPI` CPU Fallback is disabled.\r\n  * TFLite now supports `tf.math.reciprocal1` op by lowering to `tf.div op`.\r\n  * TFLite's unpack op now supports boolean tensor inputs.\r\n  * Microcontroller and embedded code moved from experimental to main TFLite folder\r\n  * Check for large TFLite tensors.\r\n  * Fix GPU delegate crash with C++17.\r\n  * Add 5D support to TFLite `strided_slice`.\r\n  * Fix error in delegation of `DEPTH_TO_SPACE` to `NNAPI` causing op not to be accelerated.\r\n  * Fix segmentation fault when running a model with LSTM nodes using `NNAPI` Delegate\r\n  * Fix `NNAPI` delegate failure when an operand for Maximum/Minimum operation is a scalar.\r\n  * Fix `NNAPI` delegate failure when Axis input for reduce operation is a scalar.\r\n  * Expose option to limit the number of partitions that will be delegated to `NNAPI`.\r\n  * If a target accelerator is specified, use its feature level to determine operations to delegate instead of SDK version.\r\n* `tf.random`:\r\n  * Various random number generation improvements: \r\n    * Add a fast path for default `random_uniform`\r\n    * `random_seed` documentation improvement.\r\n    * `RandomBinomial` broadcasts and appends the sample shape to the left rather than the right. \r\n  * Added `tf.random.stateless_binomial`, `tf.random.stateless_gamma`, `tf.random.stateless_poisson`\r\n  * `tf.random.stateless_uniform` now supports unbounded sampling of `int` types.\r\n* Math and Linear Algebra:\r\n  * Add `tf.linalg.LinearOperatorTridiag`.\r\n  * Add `LinearOperatorBlockLowerTriangular`\r\n  * Add broadcasting support to tf.linalg.triangular_solve[#26204](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/26204), tf.math.invert_permutation.\r\n  * Add `tf.math.sobol_sample` op.\r\n  * Add `tf.math.xlog1py`.\r\n  * Add `tf.math.special.{dawsn,expi,fresnel_cos,fresnel_sin,spence}`.\r\n  * Add a Modified Discrete Cosine Transform (MDCT) and its inverse to `tf.signal`.\r\n* TPU Enhancements:\r\n  * Refactor `TpuClusterResolver` to move shared logic to a separate pip package.\r\n  * Support configuring TPU software version from cloud tpu client.\r\n  * Allowed TPU embedding weight decay factor to be multiplied by learning rate.\r\n* XLA Support:\r\n  * Add standalone XLA AOT runtime target + relevant .cc sources to pip package.\r\n  * Add check for memory alignment to MemoryAllocation::MemoryAllocation() on 32-bit ARM. This ensures a deterministic early exit instead of a hard to debug bus error later.\r\n  * `saved_model_cli aot_compile_cpu` allows you to compile saved models to XLA header+object files and include them in your C++ programs.\r\n  * Enable `Igamma`, `Igammac` for XLA.\r\n  * XLA reduction emitter is deterministic when the environment variable `TF_DETERMINISTIC_OPS` is set.\r\n* Tracing and Debugging:\r\n  * Add source, destination name to `_send` traceme to allow easier debugging.\r\n  * Add traceme event to `fastpathexecute`.\r\n* Other:\r\n  * Fix an issue with AUC.reset_states for multi-label AUC [#35852](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/35852)\r\n  * Fix the TF upgrade script to not delete files when there is a parsing error and the output mode is `in-place`.\r\n  * Move `tensorflow/core:framework/*_pyclif` rules to `tensorflow/core/framework:*_pyclif`.\r\n\r\n## Thanks to our Contributors\r\n\r\nThis release contains contributions from many people at Google, as well as:\r\n\r\n372046933, 8bitmp3, aaronhma, Abin Shahab, Aditya Patwardhan, Agoniii, Ahti Kitsik, Alan Yee, Albin Joy, Alex Hoffman, Alexander Grund, Alexandre E.

    "body": "# Release 2.1.0\r\n\r\nTensorFlow 2.1 will be the last TF release supporting Python 2. Python 2 support [officially ends an January 1, 2020](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0373/#update). [As announced earlier](https://groups.google.com/a/tensorflow.org/d/msg/announce/gVwS5RC8mds/dCt1ka2XAAAJ), TensorFlow will also stop supporting Python 2 starting January 1, 2020, and no more releases are expected in 2019.\r\n\r\n## Major Features and Improvements\r\n* The `tensorflow` pip package now includes GPU support by default (same as `tensorflow-gpu`) for both Linux and Windows. This runs on machines with and without NVIDIA GPUs. `tensorflow-gpu` is still available, and CPU-only packages can be downloaded at `tensorflow-cpu` for users who are concerned about package size.\r\n* **Windows users:** Officially-released `tensorflow` Pip packages are now built with Visual Studio 2019 version 16.4 in order to take advantage of the new `/d2ReducedOptimizeHugeFunctions` compiler flag. To use these new packages, you must install \"Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2015, 2017 and 2019\", available from Microsoft's website [here](https://support.microsoft.com/help/2977003/the-latest-supported-visual-c-downloads).\r\n  * This does not change the minimum required version for building TensorFlow from source on Windows, but builds enabling `EIGEN_STRONG_INLINE` can take over 48 hours to compile without this flag. Refer to `configure.py` for more information about `EIGEN_STRONG_INLINE` and `/d2ReducedOptimizeHugeFunctions`.\r\n  * If either of the required DLLs, `msvcp140.dll` (old) or `msvcp140_1.dll` (new), are missing on your machine, `import tensorflow` will print a warning message.\r\n* The `tensorflow` pip package is built with CUDA 10.1 and cuDNN 7.6.\r\n* `tf.keras`\r\n  * Experimental support for mixed precision is available on GPUs and Cloud TPUs. See [usage guide](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/keras/mixed_precision).\r\n  * Introduced the `TextVectorization` layer, which takes as input raw strings and takes care of text standardization, tokenization, n-gram generation, and vocabulary indexing. See this [end-to-end text classification example](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1RvCnR7h0_l4Ekn5vINWToI9TNJdpUZB3). \r\n  * Keras `.compile` `.fit` `.evaluate` and `.predict` are allowed to be outside of the DistributionStrategy scope, as long as the model was constructed inside of a scope.\r\n  * Experimental support for Keras `.compile`, `.fit`, `.evaluate`, and `.predict` is available for Cloud TPUs, Cloud TPU, for all types of Keras models (sequential, functional and subclassing models).\r\n  * Automatic outside compilation is now enabled for Cloud TPUs. This allows `tf.summary` to be used more conveniently with Cloud TPUs.\r\n  * Dynamic batch sizes with DistributionStrategy and Keras are supported on Cloud TPUs.\r\n  * Support for `.fit`, `.evaluate`, `.predict` on TPU using numpy data, in addition to `tf.data.Dataset`.\r\n  * Keras reference implementations for many popular models are available in the TensorFlow [Model Garden](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/official).\r\n* `tf.data`\r\n  * Changes rebatching for `tf.data datasets` + DistributionStrategy for better performance. Note that the dataset also behaves slightly differently, in that the rebatched dataset cardinality will always be a multiple of the number of replicas.\r\n  * `tf.data.Dataset` now supports automatic data distribution and sharding in distributed environments, including on TPU pods.\r\n  * Distribution policies for `tf.data.Dataset` can now be tuned with 1. `tf.data.experimental.AutoShardPolicy(OFF, AUTO, FILE, DATA)` 2. `tf.data.experimental.ExternalStatePolicy(WARN, IGNORE, FAIL)`\r\n* `tf.debugging`\r\n  * Add `tf.debugging.enable_check_numerics()` and `tf.debugging.disable_check_numerics()` to help debugging the root causes of issues involving infinities and `NaN`s.\r\n* `tf.distribute`\r\n  * Custom training loop support on TPUs and TPU pods is avaiable through `strategy.experimental_distribute_dataset`, `strategy.experimental_distribute_datasets_from_function`, `strategy.experimental_run_v2`, `strategy.reduce`.\r\n  * Support for a global distribution strategy through `tf.distribute.experimental_set_strategy(),` in addition to `strategy.scope()`.\r\n* `TensorRT`\r\n  * [TensorRT 6.0](https://developer.nvidia.com/tensorrt#tensorrt-whats-new) is now supported and enabled by default. This adds support for more TensorFlow ops including Conv3D, Conv3DBackpropInputV2, AvgPool3D, MaxPool3D, ResizeBilinear, and ResizeNearestNeighbor. In addition, the TensorFlow-TensorRT python conversion API is exported as `tf.experimental.tensorrt.Converter`.\r\n* Environment variable `TF_DETERMINISTIC_OPS` has been added. When set to \"true\" or \"1\", this environment variable makes `tf.nn.bias_add` operate deterministically (i.e. reproducibly), but currently only when XLA JIT compilation is *not* enabled. Setting `TF_DETERMINISTIC_OPS` to \"true\" or \"1\" also makes cuDNN convolution and max-pooling operate deterministically. This makes Keras Conv\\*D and MaxPool\\*D layers operate deterministically in both the forward and backward directions when running on a CUDA-enabled GPU.\r\n\r\n## Breaking Changes\r\n* Deletes `Operation.traceback_with_start_lines` for which we know of no usages.\r\n* Removed `id` from `tf.Tensor.__repr__()` as `id` is not useful other than internal debugging.\r\n* Some `tf.assert_*` methods now raise assertions at operation creation time if the input tensors' values are known at that time, not during the `session.run()`. This only changes behavior when the graph execution would have resulted in an error. When this happens, a noop is returned and the input tensors are marked non-feedable. In other words, if they are used as keys in `feed_dict` argument to `session.run()`, an error will be raised. Also, because some assert ops don't make it into the graph, the graph structure changes. A different graph can result in different per-op random seeds when they are not given explicitly (most often).\r\n* The following APIs are not longer experimental: `tf.config.list_logical_devices`, `tf.config.list_physical_devices`, `tf.config.get_visible_devices`, `tf.config.set_visible_devices`, `tf.config.get_logical_device_configuration`, `tf.config.set_logical_device_configuration`.\r\n* `tf.config.experimentalVirtualDeviceConfiguration` has been renamed to `tf.config.LogicalDeviceConfiguration`.\r\n* `tf.config.experimental_list_devices` has been removed, please use\r\n`tf.config.list_logical_devices`.\r\n\r\n## Bug Fixes and Other Changes\r\n* `tf.data`\r\n  * Fixes concurrency issue with `tf.data.experimental.parallel_interleave` with `sloppy=True`.\r\n  * Add `tf.data.experimental.dense_to_ragged_batch()`.\r\n  * Extend `tf.data` parsing ops to support `RaggedTensors`.\r\n* `tf.distribute`\r\n  * Fix issue where GRU would crash or give incorrect output when a `tf.distribute.Strategy` was used. \r\n* `tf.estimator`\r\n  * Added option in `tf.estimator.CheckpointSaverHook` to not save the `GraphDef`.\r\n  * Moving the checkpoint reader from swig to pybind11.\r\n* `tf.keras`\r\n  * Export `depthwise_conv2d` in `tf.keras.backend`.\r\n  * In Keras Layers and Models, Variables in `trainable_weights`, `non_trainable_weights`, and `weights` are explicitly deduplicated.\r\n  * Keras `model.load_weights` now accepts `skip_mismatch` as an argument. This was available in external Keras, and has now been copied over to `tf.keras`.\r\n  * Fix the input shape caching behavior of Keras convolutional layers.\r\n  * `Model.fit_generator`, `Model.evaluate_generator`, `Model.predict_generator`, `Model.train_on_batch`, `Model.test_on_batch`, and `Model.predict_on_batch` methods now respect the `run_eagerly` property, and will correctly run using `tf.function` by default. Note that `Model.fit_generator`, `Model.evaluate_generator`, and `Model.predict_generator` are deprecated endpoints. They are subsumed by `Model.fit`, `Model.evaluate`, and `Model.predict` which now support generators and Sequences.\r\n* `tf.lite`\r\n  * Legalization for `NMS` ops in TFLite.\r\n  * add `narrow_range` and `axis` to `quantize_v2` and `dequantize` ops. \r\n  * Added support for `FusedBatchNormV3` in converter.\r\n  * Add an `errno`-like field to `NNAPI` delegate for detecting `NNAPI` errors for fallback behaviour.\r\n  * Refactors `NNAPI` Delegate to support detailed reason why an operation is not accelerated.\r\n  * Converts hardswish subgraphs into atomic ops.\r\n* Other\r\n  * Critical stability updates for TPUs, especially in cases where the XLA compiler produces compilation errors.\r\n  * TPUs can now be re-initialized multiple times, using `tf.tpu.experimental.initialize_tpu_system`. \r\n  * Add `RaggedTensor.merge_dims()`.\r\n  * Added new `uniform_row_length` row-partitioning tensor to `RaggedTensor`.\r\n  * Add `shape` arg to `RaggedTensor.to_tensor`; Improve speed of `RaggedTensor.to_tensor`.\r\n  * `tf.io.parse_sequence_example` and `tf.io.parse_single_sequence_example` now support ragged features.\r\n  * Fix `while_v2` with variables in custom gradient.\r\n  * Support taking gradients of V2 `tf.cond` and `tf.while_loop` using `LookupTable`.\r\n  * Fix bug where `vectorized_map` failed on inputs with unknown static shape.\r\n  * Add preliminary support for sparse CSR matrices.\r\n  * Tensor equality with `None` now behaves as expected.\r\n  * Make calls to `tf.function(f)()`, `tf.function(f).get_concrete_function` and `tf.function(f).get_initialization_function` thread-safe.\r\n  * Extend `tf.identity` to work with CompositeTensors (such as SparseTensor)\r\n  * Added more `dtypes` and zero-sized inputs to `Einsum` Op and improved its performance\r\n  * Enable multi-worker `NCCL` `all-reduce` inside functions executing eagerly.\r\n  * Added complex128 support to `RFFT`, `RFFT2D`, `RFFT3D`, `IRFFT`, `IRFFT2D`, and `IRFFT3D`.\r\n  * Add `pfor` converter for `SelfAdjointEigV2`.\r\n  * Add `tf.math.ndtri` and `tf.math.erfinv`.\r\n  * Add `tf.config.experimental.enable_mlir_bridge` to allow using MLIR compiler bridge in eager model.\r\n  * Added support for MatrixSolve on Cloud TPU / XLA.\r\n  * Added `tf.autodiff.ForwardAccumulator` for forward-mode autodiff\r\n  * Add `LinearOperatorPermutation`.\r\n  * A few performance optimizations on `tf.reduce_logsumexp`.\r\n  * Added multilabel handling to `AUC` metric\r\n  * Optimization on `zeros_like`.\r\n  * Dimension constructor now requires `None` or types with an `__index__` method.\r\n  * Add `tf.random.uniform` microbenchmark.\r\n  * Use `_protogen` suffix for proto library targets instead of `_cc_protogen` suffix.\r\n  * Moving the checkpoint reader from `swig` to `pybind11`.\r\n  * `tf.device` & `MirroredStrategy` now supports passing in a `tf.config.LogicalDevice`\r\n  * If you're building Tensorflow from source, consider using [bazelisk](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazelisk) to automatically download and use the correct Bazel version. Bazelisk reads the `.bazelversion` file at the root of the project directory.\r\n\r\n## Thanks to our Contributors\r\n\r\nThis release contains contributions from many people at Google, as well as:\r\n\r\n8bitmp3, Aaron Ma, AbdüLhamit Yilmaz, Abhai Kollara, aflc, Ag Ramesh, Albert Z.

    "body": "# Release 2.1.0\r\n\r\nTensorFlow 2.1 will be the last TF release supporting Python 2. Python 2 support [officially ends an January 1, 2020](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0373/#update). [As announced earlier](https://groups.google.com/a/tensorflow.org/d/msg/announce/gVwS5RC8mds/dCt1ka2XAAAJ), TensorFlow will also stop supporting Python 2 starting January 1, 2020, and no more releases are expected in 2019.\r\n\r\n## Major Features and Improvements\r\n* The `tensorflow` pip package now includes GPU support by default (same as `tensorflow-gpu`) for both Linux and Windows. This runs on machines with and without NVIDIA GPUs. `tensorflow-gpu` is still available, and CPU-only packages can be downloaded at `tensorflow-cpu` for users who are concerned about package size.\r\n* **Windows users:** Officially-released `tensorflow` Pip packages are now built with Visual Studio 2019 version 16.4 in order to take advantage of the new `/d2ReducedOptimizeHugeFunctions` compiler flag. To use these new packages, you must install \"Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2015, 2017 and 2019\", available from Microsoft's website [here](https://support.microsoft.com/help/2977003/the-latest-supported-visual-c-downloads).\r\n  * This does not change the minimum required version for building TensorFlow from source on Windows, but builds enabling `EIGEN_STRONG_INLINE` can take over 48 hours to compile without this flag. Refer to `configure.py` for more information about `EIGEN_STRONG_INLINE` and `/d2ReducedOptimizeHugeFunctions`.\r\n  * If either of the required DLLs, `msvcp140.dll` (old) or `msvcp140_1.dll` (new), are missing on your machine, `import tensorflow` will print a warning message.\r\n* The `tensorflow` pip package is built with CUDA 10.1 and cuDNN 7.6.\r\n* `tf.keras`\r\n  * Experimental support for mixed precision is available on GPUs and Cloud TPUs. See [usage guide](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/keras/mixed_precision).\r\n  * Introduced the `TextVectorization` layer, which takes as input raw strings and takes care of text standardization, tokenization, n-gram generation, and vocabulary indexing. See this [end-to-end text classification example](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1RvCnR7h0_l4Ekn5vINWToI9TNJdpUZB3). \r\n  * Keras `.compile` `.fit` `.evaluate` and `.predict` are allowed to be outside of the DistributionStrategy scope, as long as the model was constructed inside of a scope.\r\n  * Experimental support for Keras `.compile`, `.fit`, `.evaluate`, and `.predict` is available for Cloud TPUs, Cloud TPU, for all types of Keras models (sequential, functional and subclassing models).\r\n  * Automatic outside compilation is now enabled for Cloud TPUs. This allows `tf.summary` to be used more conveniently with Cloud TPUs.\r\n  * Dynamic batch sizes with DistributionStrategy and Keras are supported on Cloud TPUs.\r\n  * Support for `.fit`, `.evaluate`, `.predict` on TPU using numpy data, in addition to `tf.data.Dataset`.\r\n  * Keras reference implementations for many popular models are available in the TensorFlow [Model Garden](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/official).\r\n* `tf.data`\r\n  * Changes rebatching for `tf.data datasets` + DistributionStrategy for better performance. Note that the dataset also behaves slightly differently, in that the rebatched dataset cardinality will always be a multiple of the number of replicas.\r\n  * `tf.data.Dataset` now supports automatic data distribution and sharding in distributed environments, including on TPU pods.\r\n  * Distribution policies for `tf.data.Dataset` can now be tuned with 1. `tf.data.experimental.AutoShardPolicy(OFF, AUTO, FILE, DATA)` 2. `tf.data.experimental.ExternalStatePolicy(WARN, IGNORE, FAIL)`\r\n* `tf.debugging`\r\n  * Add `tf.debugging.enable_check_numerics()` and `tf.debugging.disable_check_numerics()` to help debugging the root causes of issues involving infinities and `NaN`s.\r\n* `tf.distribute`\r\n  * Custom training loop support on TPUs and TPU pods is avaiable through `strategy.experimental_distribute_dataset`, `strategy.experimental_distribute_datasets_from_function`, `strategy.experimental_run_v2`, `strategy.reduce`.\r\n  * Support for a global distribution strategy through `tf.distribute.experimental_set_strategy(),` in addition to `strategy.scope()`.\r\n* `TensorRT`\r\n  * [TensorRT 6.0](https://developer.nvidia.com/tensorrt#tensorrt-whats-new) is now supported and enabled by default. This adds support for more TensorFlow ops including Conv3D, Conv3DBackpropInputV2, AvgPool3D, MaxPool3D, ResizeBilinear, and ResizeNearestNeighbor. In addition, the TensorFlow-TensorRT python conversion API is exported as `tf.experimental.tensorrt.Converter`.\r\n* Environment variable `TF_DETERMINISTIC_OPS` has been added. When set to \"true\" or \"1\", this environment variable makes `tf.nn.bias_add` operate deterministically (i.e. reproducibly), but currently only when XLA JIT compilation is *not* enabled. Setting `TF_DETERMINISTIC_OPS` to \"true\" or \"1\" also makes cuDNN convolution and max-pooling operate deterministically. This makes Keras Conv\\*D and MaxPool\\*D layers operate deterministically in both the forward and backward directions when running on a CUDA-enabled GPU.\r\n\r\n## Breaking Changes\r\n* Deletes `Operation.traceback_with_start_lines` for which we know of no usages.\r\n* Removed `id` from `tf.Tensor.__repr__()` as `id` is not useful other than internal debugging.\r\n* Some `tf.assert_*` methods now raise assertions at operation creation time if the input tensors' values are known at that time, not during the `session.run()`. This only changes behavior when the graph execution would have resulted in an error. When this happens, a noop is returned and the input tensors are marked non-feedable. In other words, if they are used as keys in `feed_dict` argument to `session.run()`, an error will be raised. Also, because some assert ops don't make it into the graph, the graph structure changes. A different graph can result in different per-op random seeds when they are not given explicitly (most often).\r\n* The following APIs are not longer experimental: `tf.config.list_logical_devices`, `tf.config.list_physical_devices`, `tf.config.get_visible_devices`, `tf.config.set_visible_devices`, `tf.config.get_logical_device_configuration`, `tf.config.set_logical_device_configuration`.\r\n* `tf.config.experimentalVirtualDeviceConfiguration` has been renamed to `tf.config.LogicalDeviceConfiguration`.\r\n* `tf.config.experimental_list_devices` has been removed, please use\r\n`tf.config.list_logical_devices`.\r\n\r\n## Bug Fixes and Other Changes\r\n* `tf.data`\r\n  * Fixes concurrency issue with `tf.data.experimental.parallel_interleave` with `sloppy=True`.\r\n  * Add `tf.data.experimental.dense_to_ragged_batch()`.\r\n  * Extend `tf.data` parsing ops to support `RaggedTensors`.\r\n* `tf.distribute`\r\n  * Fix issue where GRU would crash or give incorrect output when a `tf.distribute.Strategy` was used. \r\n* `tf.estimator`\r\n  * Added option in `tf.estimator.CheckpointSaverHook` to not save the `GraphDef`.\r\n  * Moving the checkpoint reader from swig to pybind11.\r\n* `tf.keras`\r\n  * Export `depthwise_conv2d` in `tf.keras.backend`.\r\n  * In Keras Layers and Models, Variables in `trainable_weights`, `non_trainable_weights`, and `weights` are explicitly deduplicated.\r\n  * Keras `model.load_weights` now accepts `skip_mismatch` as an argument. This was available in external Keras, and has now been copied over to `tf.keras`.\r\n  * Fix the input shape caching behavior of Keras convolutional layers.\r\n  * `Model.fit_generator`, `Model.evaluate_generator`, `Model.predict_generator`, `Model.train_on_batch`, `Model.test_on_batch`, and `Model.predict_on_batch` methods now respect the `run_eagerly` property, and will correctly run using `tf.function` by default. Note that `Model.fit_generator`, `Model.evaluate_generator`, and `Model.predict_generator` are deprecated endpoints. They are subsumed by `Model.fit`, `Model.evaluate`, and `Model.predict` which now support generators and Sequences.\r\n* `tf.lite`\r\n  * Legalization for `NMS` ops in TFLite.\r\n  * add `narrow_range` and `axis` to `quantize_v2` and `dequantize` ops. \r\n  * Added support for `FusedBatchNormV3` in converter.\r\n  * Add an `errno`-like field to `NNAPI` delegate for detecting `NNAPI` errors for fallback behaviour.\r\n  * Refactors `NNAPI` Delegate to support detailed reason why an operation is not accelerated.\r\n  * Converts hardswish subgraphs into atomic ops.\r\n* Other\r\n  * Critical stability updates for TPUs, especially in cases where the XLA compiler produces compilation errors.\r\n  * TPUs can now be re-initialized multiple times, using `tf.tpu.experimental.initialize_tpu_system`. \r\n  * Add `RaggedTensor.merge_dims()`.\r\n  * Added new `uniform_row_length` row-partitioning tensor to `RaggedTensor`.\r\n  * Add `shape` arg to `RaggedTensor.to_tensor`; Improve speed of `RaggedTensor.to_tensor`.\r\n  * `tf.io.parse_sequence_example` and `tf.io.parse_single_sequence_example` now support ragged features.\r\n  * Fix `while_v2` with variables in custom gradient.\r\n  * Support taking gradients of V2 `tf.cond` and `tf.while_loop` using `LookupTable`.\r\n  * Fix bug where `vectorized_map` failed on inputs with unknown static shape.\r\n  * Add preliminary support for sparse CSR matrices.\r\n  * Tensor equality with `None` now behaves as expected.\r\n  * Make calls to `tf.function(f)()`, `tf.function(f).get_concrete_function` and `tf.function(f).get_initialization_function` thread-safe.\r\n  * Extend `tf.identity` to work with CompositeTensors (such as SparseTensor)\r\n  * Added more `dtypes` and zero-sized inputs to `Einsum` Op and improved its performance\r\n  * Enable multi-worker `NCCL` `all-reduce` inside functions executing eagerly.\r\n  * Added complex128 support to `RFFT`, `RFFT2D`, `RFFT3D`, `IRFFT`, `IRFFT2D`, and `IRFFT3D`.\r\n  * Add `pfor` converter for `SelfAdjointEigV2`.\r\n  * Add `tf.math.ndtri` and `tf.math.erfinv`.\r\n  * Add `tf.config.experimental.enable_mlir_bridge` to allow using MLIR compiler bridge in eager model.\r\n  * Added support for MatrixSolve on Cloud TPU / XLA.\r\n  * Added `tf.autodiff.ForwardAccumulator` for forward-mode autodiff\r\n  * Add `LinearOperatorPermutation`.\r\n  * A few performance optimizations on `tf.reduce_logsumexp`.\r\n  * Added multilabel handling to `AUC` metric\r\n  * Optimization on `zeros_like`.\r\n  * Dimension constructor now requires `None` or types with an `__index__` method.\r\n  * Add `tf.random.uniform` microbenchmark.\r\n  * Use `_protogen` suffix for proto library targets instead of `_cc_protogen` suffix.\r\n  * Moving the checkpoint reader from `swig` to `pybind11`.\r\n  * `tf.device` & `MirroredStrategy` now supports passing in a `tf.config.LogicalDevice`\r\n  * If you're building Tensorflow from source, consider using [bazelisk](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazelisk) to automatically download and use the correct Bazel version. Bazelisk reads the `.bazelversion` file at the root of the project directory.\r\n\r\n## Thanks to our Contributors\r\n\r\nThis release contains contributions from many people at Google, as well as:\r\n\r\n8bitmp3, Aaron Ma, AbdüLhamit Yilmaz, Abhai Kollara, aflc, Ag Ramesh, Albert Z.

    "body": "# Release 2.1.0-rc1\r\n\r\nTensorFlow 2.1 will be the last TF release supporting Python 2. Python 2 support [officially ends an January 1, 2020](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0373/#update). [As announced earlier](https://groups.google.com/a/tensorflow.org/d/msg/announce/gVwS5RC8mds/dCt1ka2XAAAJ), TensorFlow will also stop supporting Python 2 starting January 1, 2020, and no more releases are expected in 2019.\r\n\r\n## Major Features and Improvements\r\n* The `tensorflow` pip package now includes GPU support by default (same as `tensorflow-gpu`) for both Linux and Windows. This runs on machines with and without NVIDIA GPUs. `tensorflow-gpu` is still available, and CPU-only packages can be downloaded at `tensorflow-cpu` for users who are concerned about package size.\r\n* The `tensorflow` pip package is built with CUDA 10.1 and cuDNN 7.6.\r\n* `tf.keras`\r\n  * `Model.fit_generator`, `Model.evaluate_generator`, `Model.predict_generator`, `Model.train_on_batch`, `Model.test_on_batch`, and `Model.predict_on_batch` methods now respect the `run_eagerly` property, and will correctly run using tf.function by default.\r\n  * `Model.fit_generator`, `Model.evaluate_generator`, and `Model.predict_generator` are deprecated endpoints. They are subsumed by `Model.fit`, `Model.evaluate`, and `Model.predict` which now support generators and Sequences.\r\n  * Keras `.compile` `.fit` `.evaluate` and `.predict` are allowed to be outside of the DistributionStrategy scope, as long as the model was constructed inside of a scope.\r\n  * Keras `model.load_weights` now accepts `skip_mismatch` as an argument. This was available in external Keras, and has now been copied over to `tf.keras`.\r\n  * Introduced the `TextVectorization` layer, which takes as input raw strings and takes care of text standardization, tokenization, n-gram generation, and vocabulary indexing. See this [end-to-end text classification example](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1RvCnR7h0_l4Ekn5vINWToI9TNJdpUZB3). \r\n  * Experimental support for Keras `.compile`, `.fit`, `.evaluate`, and `.predict` is available for Cloud TPU Pods.\r\n  * Automatic outside compilation is now enabled for Cloud TPUs. This allows `tf.summary` to be used more conveniently with Cloud TPUs.\r\n  * Dynamic batch sizes with DistributionStrategy and Keras are supported on Cloud TPUs.\r\n  * Experimental support for mixed precision is available on GPUs and Cloud TPUs.\r\n  * Keras reference implementations for many popular models are available in the TensorFlow [Model Garden](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/official).\r\n* `tf.data`\r\n  * Changes rebatching for `tf.data datasets` + distribution strategies for better performance.   Note that the dataset also behaves slightly differently, in that the rebatched dataset cardinality will always be a multiple of the number of replicas.\r\n* `TensorRT`\r\n  * [TensorRT 6.0](https://developer.nvidia.com/tensorrt#tensorrt-whats-new) is now supported and enabled by default. This adds support for more TensorFlow ops including Conv3D, Conv3DBackpropInputV2, AvgPool3D, MaxPool3D, ResizeBilinear, and ResizeNearestNeighbor. In addition, the TensorFlow-TensorRT python conversion API is exported as `tf.experimental.tensorrt.Converter`.\r\n* Environment variable `TF_DETERMINISTIC_OPS` has been added. When set to \"true\" or \"1\", this environment variable makes `tf.nn.bias_add` operate deterministically (i.e. reproducibly), but currently only when XLA JIT compilation is *not* enabled. Setting `TF_DETERMINISTIC_OPS` to \"true\" or \"1\" also makes cuDNN convolution and max-pooling operate deterministically. This makes Keras Conv\\*D and MaxPool\\*D layers operate deterministically in both the forward and backward directions when running on a CUDA-enabled GPU.\r\n\r\n## Breaking Changes\r\n* Deletes `Operation.traceback_with_start_lines` for which we know of no usages.\r\n* Removed `id` from `tf.Tensor.__repr__()` as `id` is not useful other than internal debugging.\r\n* Some `tf.assert_*` methods now raise assertions at operation creation time if the input tensors' values are known at that time, not during the `session.run()`. This only changes behavior when the graph execution would have resulted in an error. When this happens, a noop is returned and the input tensors are marked non-feedable. In other words, if they are used as keys in `feed_dict` argument to `session.run()`, an error will be raised. Also, because some assert ops don't make it into the graph, the graph structure changes. A different graph can result in different per-op random seeds when they are not given explicitly (most often).\r\n* The following APIs are no longer experimental: `tf.config.list_logical_devices`, `tf.config.list_physical_devices`, `tf.config.get_visible_devices`, `tf.config.set_visible_devices`, `tf.config.get_logical_device_configuration`, `tf.config.set_logical_device_configuration`.\r\n* `tf.config.experimentalVirtualDeviceConfiguration` has been renamed to `tf.config.LogicalDeviceConfiguration`.\r\n* `tf.config.experimental_list_devices` has been removed, please use\r\n`tf.config.list_logical_devices`.\r\n\r\n## Bug Fixes and Other Changes\r\n* `tf.data`\r\n  * Fixes concurrency issue with `tf.data.experimental.parallel_interleave` with sloppy=True.\r\n  * Add `tf.data.experimental.dense_to_ragged_batch()`.\r\n  * Extend `tf.data` parsing ops to support `RaggedTensors`.\r\n* `tf.distribute`\r\n  * Fix issue where GRU would crash or give incorrect output when a `tf.distribute.Strategy` was used. \r\n* `tf.estimator`\r\n  * Added option in `tf.estimator.CheckpointSaverHook` to not save the `GraphDef`.\r\n  * Moving the checkpoint reader from swig to pybind11.\r\n* `tf.keras`\r\n  * Export depthwise_conv2d in `tf.keras.backend`.\r\n  * In Keras Layers and Models, Variables in `trainable_weights`, `non_trainable_weights`, and `weights` are explicitly deduplicated.\r\n  * Fix the incorrect stateful behavior of Keras convolutional layers.\r\n* `tf.lite`\r\n  * Legalization for `NMS` ops in TFLite.\r\n  * add `narrow_range` and `axis` to `quantize_v2` and `dequantize` ops. \r\n  * Added support for `FusedBatchNormV3` in converter.\r\n  * Add an `errno`-like field to `NNAPI` delegate for detecting `NNAPI` errors for fallback behaviour.\r\n  * Refactors `NNAPI` Delegate to support detailed reason why an operation is not accelerated.\r\n  * Converts hardswish subgraphs into atomic ops.\r\n* Other\r\n  * Add `RaggedTensor.merge_dims()`.\r\n  * Added new `uniform_row_length` row-partitioning tensor to `RaggedTensor`.\r\n  * Add `shape` arg to `RaggedTensor.to_tensor`; Improve speed of `RaggedTensor.to_tensor`.\r\n  * `tf.io.parse_sequence_example` and `tf.io.parse_single_sequence_example` now support ragged features.\r\n  * Fix `while_v2` with variables in custom gradient.\r\n  * Support taking gradients of V2 `tf.cond` and `tf.while_loop` using `LookupTable`.\r\n  * Fix bug where `vectorized_map` failed on inputs with unknown static shape.\r\n  * Add preliminary support for sparse CSR matrices.\r\n  * Tensor equality with `None` now behaves as expected.\r\n  * Make calls to `tf.function(f)()`, `tf.function(f).get_concrete_function` and `tf.function(f).get_initialization_function` thread-safe.\r\n  * Add `tf.debugging.enable_check_numerics()` and `tf.debugging.disable_check_numerics()` to facilitate debugging of numeric instability (`Infinity`s and `NaN`s) under eager mode and `tf.function`s.\r\n  * Extend `tf.identity` to work with CompositeTensors (such as SparseTensor)\r\n  * Added more `dtypes` and zero-sized inputs to `Einsum` Op and improved its performance\r\n  * Enable multi-worker `NCCL` `all-reduce` inside functions executing eagerly.\r\n  * Added complex128 support to `RFFT`, `RFFT2D`, `RFFT3D`, `IRFFT`, `IRFFT2D`, and `IRFFT3D`.\r\n  * Add `pfor` converter for `SelfAdjointEigV2`.\r\n  * Add `tf.math.ndtri` and `tf.math.erfinv`.\r\n  * Add `tf.config.experimental.enable_mlir_bridge` to allow using MLIR compiler bridge in eager model.\r\n  * Added support for MatrixSolve on Cloud TPU / XLA.\r\n  * Added `tf.autodiff.ForwardAccumulator` for forward-mode autodiff\r\n  * Add `LinearOperatorPermutation`.\r\n  * A few performance optimizations on `tf.reduce_logsumexp`.\r\n  * Added multilabel handling to `AUC` metric\r\n  * Optimization on `zeros_like`.\r\n  * Dimension constructor now requires `None` or types with an `__index__` method.\r\n  * Add `tf.random.uniform` microbenchmark.\r\n  * Use `_protogen` suffix for proto library targets instead of `_cc_protogen` suffix.\r\n  * Moving the checkpoint reader from `swig` to `pybind11`.\r\n  * `tf.device` & `MirroredStrategy` now supports passing in a `tf.config.LogicalDevice`\r\n  * If you're building Tensorflow from source, consider using [bazelisk](https://github.com/bazelisk/bazel) to automatically download and use the correct Bazel version.

    "body": "# Release 1.15.0\r\nThis is the last 1.x release for TensorFlow. We do not expect to update the 1.x branch with features, although we will issue patch releases to fix vulnerabilities for at least one year.\r\n\r\n## Major Features and Improvements\r\n* As [announced](https://groups.google.com/a/tensorflow.org/forum/#!topic/developers/iRCt5m4qUz0), `tensorflow` pip package will by default include GPU support (same as `tensorflow-gpu` now) for the platforms we currently have GPU support (Linux and Windows). It will work on machines with and without Nvidia GPUs. `tensorflow-gpu` will still be available, and CPU-only packages can be downloaded at `tensorflow-cpu` for users who are concerned about package size.\r\n* TensorFlow 1.15 contains a complete implementation of the 2.0 API in its `compat.v2` module. It contains a copy of the 1.15 main module (without `contrib`) in the `compat.v1` module. TensorFlow 1.15 is able to emulate 2.0 behavior using the `enable_v2_behavior()` function.\r\nThis enables writing forward compatible code: by explicitly importing either `tensorflow.compat.v1` or `tensorflow.compat.v2`, you can ensure that your code works without modifications against an installation of 1.15 or 2.0.\r\n* `EagerTensor` now supports numpy buffer interface for tensors.\r\n* Add toggles `tf.enable_control_flow_v2()` and `tf.disable_control_flow_v2()` for enabling/disabling v2 control flow.\r\n* Enable v2 control flow as part of `tf.enable_v2_behavior()` and `TF2_BEHAVIOR=1`.\r\n* AutoGraph translates Python control flow into TensorFlow expressions, allowing users to write regular Python inside `tf.function`-decorated functions. AutoGraph is also applied in functions used with `tf.data`, `tf.distribute` and `tf.keras` APIS.\r\n* Adds `enable_tensor_equality()`, which switches the behavior such that: \r\n  * Tensors are no longer hashable.\r\n  * Tensors can be compared with `==` and `!=`, yielding a Boolean Tensor with element-wise comparison results. This will be the default behavior in 2.0.\r\n* Auto Mixed-Precision graph optimizer simplifies converting models to `float16` for acceleration on Volta and Turing Tensor Cores. This feature can be enabled by wrapping an optimizer class with `tf.train.experimental.enable_mixed_precision_graph_rewrite()`.\r\n* Add environment variable `TF_CUDNN_DETERMINISTIC`. Setting to \"true\" or \"1\" forces the selection of deterministic cuDNN convolution and max-pooling algorithms. When this is enabled, the algorithm selection procedure itself is also deterministic.\r\n* TensorRT\r\n  * Migrate TensorRT conversion sources from contrib to compiler directory in preparation for TF 2.0.\r\n  * Add additional, user friendly `TrtGraphConverter` API for TensorRT conversion.\r\n  * Expand support for TensorFlow operators in TensorRT conversion (e.g.\r\n    `Gather`, `Slice`, `Pack`, `Unpack`, `ArgMin`, `ArgMax`,`DepthSpaceShuffle`). \r\n  * Support TensorFlow operator `CombinedNonMaxSuppression` in TensorRT conversion which \r\n     significantly accelerates object detection models.\r\n\r\n## Breaking Changes\r\n* Tensorflow code now produces 2 different pip packages: `tensorflow_core` containing all the code (in the future it will contain only the private implementation) and `tensorflow` which is a virtual pip package doing forwarding to `tensorflow_core` (and in the future will contain only the public API of tensorflow). We don't expect this to be breaking, unless you were importing directly from the implementation.\r\n* TensorFlow 1.15 is built using devtoolset7 (GCC7) on Ubuntu 16. This may lead to ABI incompatibilities with extensions built against earlier versions of TensorFlow.\r\n* Deprecated the use of `constraint=` and `.constraint` with ResourceVariable.\r\n* `tf.keras`:\r\n  * `OMP_NUM_THREADS` is no longer used by the default Keras config. To configure the number of threads, use `tf.config.threading` APIs.\r\n  * `tf.keras.model.save_model` and `model.save` now defaults to saving a TensorFlow SavedModel.\r\n  * `keras.backend.resize_images` (and consequently, `keras.layers.Upsampling2D`) behavior has changed, a bug in the resizing implementation was fixed.\r\n  * Layers now default to `float32`, and automatically cast their inputs to the layer's dtype. If you had a model that used `float64`, it will probably silently use `float32` in TensorFlow2, and a warning will be issued that starts with Layer \"layer-name\" is casting an input tensor from dtype float64 to the layer's dtype of float32. To fix, either set the default dtype to float64 with `tf.keras.backend.set_floatx('float64')`, or pass `dtype='float64'` to each of the Layer constructors. See `tf.keras.layers.Layer` for more information.\r\n  * Some `tf.assert_*` methods now raise assertions at operation creation time (i.e. when this Python line executes) if the input tensors' values are known at that time, not during the session.run(). When this happens, a noop is returned and the input tensors are marked non-feedable. In other words, if they are used as keys in `feed_dict` argument to `session.run()`, an error will be raised. Also, because some assert ops don't make it into the graph, the graph structure changes. A different graph can result in different per-op random seeds when they are not given explicitly (most often).\r\n\r\n## Bug Fixes and Other Changes\r\n* `tf.estimator`:\r\n  * `tf.keras.estimator.model_to_estimator` now supports exporting to `tf.train.Checkpoint` format, which allows the saved checkpoints to be compatible with `model.load_weights`.\r\n  * Fix tests in canned estimators.\r\n  * Expose Head as public API.\r\n  * Fixes critical bugs that help with `DenseFeatures` usability in TF2\r\n* `tf.data`:\r\n  * Promoting `unbatch` from experimental to core API.\r\n  * Adding support for datasets as inputs to `from_tensors` and `from_tensor_slices` and batching and unbatching of nested datasets.\r\n* `tf.keras`:\r\n  * `tf.keras.estimator.model_to_estimator` now supports exporting to tf.train.Checkpoint format, which allows the saved checkpoints to be compatible with `model.load_weights`.\r\n  * Saving a Keras Model using `tf.saved_model.save` now saves the list of variables, trainable variables, regularization losses, and the call function.\r\n  * Deprecated `tf.keras.experimental.export_saved_model` and `tf.keras.experimental.function`. Please use `tf.keras.models.save_model(..., save_format='tf')` and `tf.keras.models.load_model` instead.\r\n  * Add an `implementation=3` mode for `tf.keras.layers.LocallyConnected2D` and `tf.keras.layers.LocallyConnected1D` layers using `tf.SparseTensor` to store weights,  allowing a dramatic speedup for large sparse models.\r\n  * Enable the Keras compile API `experimental_run_tf_function` flag by default. This flag enables single training/eval/predict execution path. With this 1. All input types are converted to `Dataset`. 2. When distribution strategy is not specified this goes through the no-op distribution strategy path. 3. Execution is wrapped in tf.function unless `run_eagerly=True` is set in compile.\r\n  * Raise error if `batch_size` argument is used when input is dataset/generator/keras sequence.\r\n* `tf.lite`\r\n  * Add `GATHER` support to NN API delegate.\r\n  * tflite object detection script has a debug mode.\r\n  * Add delegate support for `QUANTIZE`.\r\n  * Added evaluation script for COCO minival.\r\n  * Add delegate support for `QUANTIZED_16BIT_LSTM`.\r\n  * Converts hardswish subgraphs into atomic ops.\r\n* Add support for defaulting the value of `cycle_length` argument of `tf.data.Dataset.interleave` to the number of schedulable CPU cores.\r\n* `parallel_for`: Add converter for `MatrixDiag`.\r\n* Add `narrow_range` attribute to `QuantizeAndDequantizeV2` and V3.\r\n* Added new op: `tf.strings.unsorted_segment_join`.\r\n* Add HW acceleration support for `topK_v2`.\r\n* Add new `TypeSpec` classes.\r\n* CloudBigtable version updated to v0.10.0.\r\n* Expose `Head` as public API.\r\n* Update docstring for gather to properly describe the non-empty `batch_dims` case.\r\n* Added `tf.sparse.from_dense` utility function.\r\n* Improved ragged tensor support in `TensorFlowTestCase`.\r\n* Makes the a-normal form transformation in Pyct configurable as to which nodes are converted to variables and which are not.\r\n* `ResizeInputTensor` now works for all delegates.\r\n* Add `EXPAND_DIMS` support to NN API delegate TEST:  expand_dims_test\r\n* `tf.cond` emits a StatelessIf op if the branch functions are stateless and do not touch any resources.\r\n* `tf.cond`, `tf.while` and `if` and `while` in AutoGraph now accept a nonscalar predicate if has a single element. This does not affect non-V2 control flow.\r\n* `tf.while_loop` emits a StatelessWhile op if the cond and body functions are stateless and do not touch any resources.\r\n* Refactors code in Quant8 LSTM support to reduce TFLite binary size.\r\n* Add support of local soft device placement for eager op.\r\n* Add HW acceleration support for `LogSoftMax`.\r\n* Added a function `nested_value_rowids` for ragged tensors.\r\n* Add guard to avoid acceleration of L2 Normalization with input rank != 4\r\n* Add `tf.math.cumulative_logsumexp operation`.\r\n* Add `tf.ragged.stack`.\r\n* Fix memory allocation problem when calling `AddNewInputConstantTensor`.\r\n* Delegate application failure leaves interpreter in valid state.\r\n* Add check for correct memory alignment to `MemoryAllocation::MemoryAllocation()`.\r\n* Extracts `NNAPIDelegateKernel` from nnapi_delegate.cc\r\n* Added support for `FusedBatchNormV3` in converter.\r\n* A ragged to dense op for directly calculating tensors.\r\n* Fix accidental quadratic graph construction cost in graph-mode `tf.gradients()`.\r\n* The `precision_mode` argument to `TrtGraphConverter` is now case insensitive.\r\n\r\n## Thanks to our Contributors\r\n\r\nThis release contains contributions from many people at Google, as well as:\r\n\r\na6802739, Aaron Ma, Abdullah Selek, Abolfazl Shahbazi, Ag Ramesh, Albert Z.

    "body": "# Release 1.15.0-rc2\r\nThis is the last 1.x release for TensorFlow. We do not expect to update the 1.x branch with features, although we will issue patch releases to fix vulnerabilities for at least one year. \r\n\r\n## Major Features and Improvements\r\n* As [announced](https://groups.google.com/a/tensorflow.org/forum/#!topic/developers/iRCt5m4qUz0), `tensorflow` pip package will by default include GPU support (same as `tensorflow-gpu` now) for the platforms we currently have GPU support (Linux and Windows). It will work on machines with and without Nvidia GPUs. `tensorflow-gpu` will still be available, and CPU-only packages can be downloaded at `tensorflow-cpu` for users who are concerned about package size.\r\n* TensorFlow 1.15 contains a complete implementation of the 2.0 API in its `compat.v2 module`. It contains a copy of the 1.15 main module (without `contrib`) in the `compat.v1 module`. TensorFlow 1.15 is able to emulate 2.0 behavior using the `enable_v2_behavior()` function.\r\nThis enables writing forward compatible code: by explicitly importing either `tensorflow.compat.v1` or `tensorflow.compat.v2`, you can ensure that your code works without modifications against an installation of 1.15 or 2.0.\r\n* EagerTensor now supports numpy buffer interface for tensors.\r\n* Add toggles `tf.enable_control_flow_v2()` and `tf.disable_control_flow_v2()` for enabling/disabling v2 control flow.\r\n* Enable v2 control flow as part of `tf.enable_v2_behavior()` and `TF2_BEHAVIOR=1`.\r\n* AutoGraph translates Python control flow into TensorFlow expressions, allowing users to write regular Python inside `tf.function`-decorated functions. AutoGraph is also applied in functions used with `tf.data`, `tf.distribute` and `tf.keras` APIS.\r\n* Adds `enable_tensor_equality()`, which switches the behavior such that: \r\n  * Tensors are no longer hashable.\r\n  * Tensors can be compared with == and !=, yielding a Boolean Tensor with element-wise comparison results. This will be the default behavior in 2.0.\r\n* Auto Mixed-Precision graph optimizer simplifies converting models to float16 for acceleration on Volta and Turing Tensor Cores. This feature can be enabled by wrapping an optimizer class with `tf.train.experimental.enable_mixed_precision_graph_rewrite()`.\r\n* Add environment variable `TF_CUDNN_DETERMINISTIC`. Setting to \"true\" or \"1\" forces the selection of deterministic cuDNN convolution and max-pooling algorithms. When this is enabled, the algorithm selection procedure itself is also deterministic.\r\n* TensorRT\r\n  * Migrate TensorRT conversion sources from contrib to compiler directory in preparation for TF 2.0.\r\n  * Add additional, user friendly `TrtGraphConverter` API for TensorRT conversion.\r\n  * Expand support for TensorFlow operators in TensorRT conversion (e.g.\r\n    `Gather`, `Slice`, `Pack`, `Unpack`, `ArgMin`, `ArgMax`,`DepthSpaceShuffle`). \r\n  * Support TensorFlow operator `CombinedNonMaxSuppression` in TensorRT conversion which \r\n     significantly accelerates object detection models.\r\n\r\n## Breaking Changes\r\n* Tensorflow code now produces 2 different pip packages: tensorflow_core containing all the code (in the future it will contain only the private implementation) and tensorflow which is a virtual pip package doing forwarding to tensorflow_core (and in the future will contain only the public API of tensorflow). We don't expect this to be breaking, unless you were importing directly from the implementation.\r\n* TensorFlow 1.15 is built using devtoolset7 (GCC7) on Ubuntu 16. This may lead to ABI incompatibilities with extensions built against earlier versions of TensorFlow.\r\n* Deprecated the use of `constraint=` and `.constraint` with ResourceVariable.\r\n* `tf.keras`:\r\n  * `OMP_NUM_THREADS` is no longer used by the default Keras config. To configure the number of threads, use `tf.config.threading` APIs.\r\n  * `tf.keras.model.save_model` and `model.save` now defaults to saving a TensorFlow SavedModel.\r\n  * `keras.backend.resize_images` (and consequently, `keras.layers.Upsampling2D`) behavior has changed, a bug in the resizing implementation was fixed.\r\n  * Layers now default to `float32`, and automatically cast their inputs to the layer's dtype. If you had a model that used `float64`, it will probably silently use `float32` in TensorFlow2, and a warning will be issued that starts with Layer \"layer-name\" is casting an input tensor from dtype float64 to the layer's dtype of float32. To fix, either set the default dtype to float64 with `tf.keras.backend.set_floatx('float64')`, or pass `dtype='float64'` to each of the Layer constructors. See `tf.keras.layers.Layer` for more information.\r\n  * Some `tf.assert_*` methods now raise assertions at operation creation time (i.e. when this Python line executes) if the input tensors' values are known at that time, not during the session.run(). When this happens, a noop is returned and the input tensors are marked non-feedable. In other words, if they are used as keys in `feed_dict` argument to `session.run()`, an error will be raised. Also, because some assert ops don't make it into the graph, the graph structure changes. A different graph can result in different per-op random seeds when they are not given explicitly (most often).\r\n\r\n## Bug Fixes and Other Changes\r\n* `tf.estimator`:\r\n  * `tf.keras.estimator.model_to_estimator` now supports exporting to `tf.train.Checkpoint` format, which allows the saved checkpoints to be compatible with `model.load_weights`.\r\n  * Fix tests in canned estimators.\r\n  * Expose Head as public API.\r\n  * Fixes critical bugs that help with `DenseFeatures` usability in TF2\r\n* `tf.data`:\r\n  * Promoting `unbatch` from experimental to core API.\r\n  * Adding support for datasets as inputs to `from_tensors` and `from_tensor_slices` and batching and unbatching of nested datasets.\r\n* `tf.keras`:\r\n  * `tf.keras.estimator.model_to_estimator` now supports exporting to tf.train.Checkpoint format, which allows the saved checkpoints to be compatible with `model.load_weights`.\r\n  * Saving a Keras Model using `tf.saved_model.save` now saves the list of variables, trainable variables, regularization losses, and the call function.\r\n  * Deprecated `tf.keras.experimental.export_saved_model` and `tf.keras.experimental.function`. Please use `tf.keras.models.save_model(..., save_format='tf')` and `tf.keras.models.load_model` instead.\r\n  * Add an `implementation=3` mode for `tf.keras.layers.LocallyConnected2D` and `tf.keras.layers.LocallyConnected1D` layers using `tf.SparseTensor` to store weights,  allowing a dramatic speedup for large sparse models.\r\n  * Enable the Keras compile API `experimental_run_tf_function` flag by default. This flag enables single training/eval/predict execution path. With this 1. All input types are converted to `Dataset`. 2. When distribution strategy is not specified this goes through the no-op distribution strategy path. 3. Execution is wrapped in tf.function unless `run_eagerly=True` is set in compile.\r\n  * Raise error if `batch_size` argument is used when input is dataset/generator/keras sequence.\r\n* `tf.lite`\r\n  * Add `GATHER` support to NN API delegate.\r\n  * tflite object detection script has a debug mode.\r\n  * Add delegate support for `QUANTIZE`.\r\n  * Added evaluation script for COCO minival.\r\n  * Add delegate support for `QUANTIZED_16BIT_LSTM`.\r\n  * Converts hardswish subgraphs into atomic ops.\r\n* Add support for defaulting the value of `cycle_length` argument of `tf.data.Dataset.interleave` to the number of schedulable CPU cores.\r\n* `parallel_for`: Add converter for `MatrixDiag`.\r\n* Add `narrow_range` attribute to `QuantizeAndDequantizeV2` and V3.\r\n* Added new op: `tf.strings.unsorted_segment_join`.\r\n* Add HW acceleration support for `topK_v2`.\r\n* Add new `TypeSpec` classes.\r\n* CloudBigtable version updated to v0.10.0.\r\n* Expose `Head` as public API.\r\n* Update docstring for gather to properly describe the non-empty `batch_dims` case.\r\n* Added `tf.sparse.from_dense` utility function.\r\n* Improved ragged tensor support in `TensorFlowTestCase`.\r\n* Makes the a-normal form transformation in Pyct configurable as to which nodes are converted to variables and which are not.\r\n* `ResizeInputTensor` now works for all delegates.\r\n* Add `EXPAND_DIMS` support to NN API delegate TEST:  expand_dims_test\r\n* `tf.cond` emits a StatelessIf op if the branch functions are stateless and do not touch any resources.\r\n* `tf.cond`, `tf.while` and `if` and `while` in AutoGraph now accept a nonscalar predicate if has a single element. This does not affect non-V2 control flow.\r\n* `tf.while_loop` emits a StatelessWhile op if the cond and body functions are stateless and do not touch any resources.\r\n* Refactors code in Quant8 LSTM support to reduce TFLite binary size.\r\n* Add support of local soft device placement for eager op.\r\n* Add HW acceleration support for `LogSoftMax`.\r\n* Added a function `nested_value_rowids` for ragged tensors.\r\n* Add guard to avoid acceleration of L2 Normalization with input rank != 4\r\n* Add `tf.math.cumulative_logsumexp operation`.\r\n* Add `tf.ragged.stack`.\r\n* Fix memory allocation problem when calling `AddNewInputConstantTensor`.\r\n* Delegate application failure leaves interpreter in valid state.\r\n* Add check for correct memory alignment to `MemoryAllocation::MemoryAllocation()`.\r\n* Extracts `NNAPIDelegateKernel` from nnapi_delegate.cc\r\n* Added support for `FusedBatchNormV3` in converter.\r\n* A ragged to dense op for directly calculating tensors.\r\n* Fix accidental quadratic graph construction cost in graph-mode `tf.gradients()`.\r\n* The `precision_mode` argument to `TrtGraphConverter` is now case insensitive.\r\n\r\n## Thanks to our Contributors\r\n\r\nThis release contains contributions from many people at Google, as well as:\r\n\r\na6802739, Aaron Ma, Abdullah Selek, Abolfazl Shahbazi, Ag Ramesh, Albert Z.

We have also released a collection of [tutorials and getting started guides](https://www.tensorflow.org/beta).\r\n\r\n## Highlights\r\n\r\n* TF 2.0 delivers Keras as the central high level API used to build and train models. Keras provides several model-building APIs such as Sequential, Functional, and Subclassing along with eager execution, for immediate iteration and intuitive debugging, and `tf.data`, for building scalable input pipelines. Checkout [guide](https://www.tensorflow.org/beta/guide/keras/overview) for additional details.\r\n* Distribution Strategy: TF 2.0 users will be able to use the [`tf.distribute.Strategy`](https://www.tensorflow.org/beta/guide/distribute_strategy) API to distribute training with minimal code changes, yielding great out-of-the-box performance. It supports distributed training with Keras model.fit, as well as with custom training loops. Multi-GPU support is available, along with experimental support for multi worker and Cloud TPUs. Check out the [guide](https://www.tensorflow.org/beta/guide/distribute_strategy) for more details.\r\n* Functions, not Sessions. The traditional declarative programming model of building a graph and executing it via a `tf.Session` is discouraged, and replaced with by writing regular Python functions. Using the `tf.function` decorator, such functions can be turned into graphs which can be executed remotely, serialized, and optimized for performance.\r\n* Unification of `tf.train.Optimizers` and `tf.keras.Optimizers`. Use `tf.keras.Optimizers` for TF2.0. `compute_gradients` is removed as public API, use `GradientTape` to compute gradients.\r\n* AutoGraph translates Python control flow into TensorFlow expressions, allowing users to write regular Python inside `tf.function`-decorated functions. AutoGraph is also applied in functions used with tf.data, tf.distribute and tf.keras APIs. \r\n* Unification of exchange formats to SavedModel. All TensorFlow ecosystem projects (TensorFlow Lite, TensorFlow JS, TensorFlow Serving, TensorFlow Hub) accept SavedModels. Model state should be saved to and restored from SavedModels.\r\n* API Changes: Many API symbols have been renamed or removed, and argument names have changed. Many of these changes are motivated by consistency and clarity. The 1.x API remains available in the compat.v1 module. A list of all symbol changes can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FLFJLzg7WNP6JHODX5q8BDgptKafq_slHpnHVbJIteQ/edit#gid=0). \r\n * API clean-up, included removing `tf.app`, `tf.flags`, and `tf.logging` in favor of [absl-py](https://github.com/abseil/abseil-py).\r\n* No more global variables with helper methods like `tf.global_variables_initializer` and `tf.get_global_step`.\r\n* Add toggles `tf.enable_control_flow_v2()` and `tf.disable_control_flow_v2()` for enabling/disabling v2 control flow.\r\n* Enable v2 control flow as part of `tf.enable_v2_behavior()` and `TF2_BEHAVIOR=1`.\r\n* Fixes autocomplete for most TensorFlow API references by switching to use relative imports in API `__init__.py` files.\r\n* Auto Mixed-Precision graph optimizer simplifies converting models to `float16` for acceleration on Volta and Turing Tensor Cores. This feature can be enabled by wrapping an optimizer class with `tf.train.experimental.enable_mixed_precision_graph_rewrite()`.\r\n* Add environment variable `TF_CUDNN_DETERMINISTIC`. Setting to `TRUE` or \"1\" forces the selection of deterministic cuDNN convolution and max-pooling algorithms. When this is enabled, the algorithm selection procedure itself is also deterministic.\r\n\r\n## Breaking Changes\r\n* Many backwards incompatible API changes have been made to clean up the APIs and make them more consistent.\r\n* Toolchains:\r\n  * TensorFlow 2.0.0 is built using devtoolset7 (GCC7) on Ubuntu 16. This may lead to ABI incompatibilities with extensions built against earlier versions of TensorFlow.\r\n  * Tensorflow code now produces 2 different pip packages: tensorflow_core containing all the code (in the future it will contain only the private implementation) and tensorflow which is a virtual pip package doing forwarding to tensorflow_core (and in the future will contain only the public API of tensorflow). We don't expect this to be breaking, unless you were importing directly from the implementation.\r\n  Removed the `freeze_graph` command line tool; `SavedModel` should be used in place of frozen graphs.\r\n  \r\n* `tf.contrib`:\r\n  * `tf.contrib` has been deprecated, and functionality has been either migrated to the core TensorFlow API, to an ecosystem project such as [tensorflow/addons](https://www.github.com/tensorflow/addons) or [tensorflow/io](https://www.github.com/tensorflow/io), or removed entirely.\r\n  * Remove `tf.contrib.timeseries` dependency on TF distributions.\r\n  * Replace contrib references with `tf.estimator.experimental.*` for apis in `early_stopping.py`.\r\n  \r\n* `tf.estimator`:\r\n  * Premade estimators in the tf.estimator.DNN/Linear/DNNLinearCombined family have been updated to use `tf.keras.optimizers` instead of the `tf.compat.v1.train.Optimizer`s. If you do not pass in an `optimizer=` arg or if you use a string, the premade estimator will use the Keras optimizer. This is checkpoint breaking, as the optimizers have separate variables. A checkpoint converter tool for converting optimizers is included with the release,  but if you want to avoid any change, switch to the v1 version of the estimator:  `tf.compat.v1.estimator.DNN/Linear/DNNLinearCombined*`.\r\n  * Default aggregation for canned Estimators is now `SUM_OVER_BATCH_SIZE`. To maintain previous default behavior, please pass `SUM` as the loss aggregation method.\r\n  * Canned Estimators don’t support `input_layer_partitioner` arg in the API. If you have this arg, you will have to switch to `tf.compat.v1 canned Estimators`.\r\n  * `Estimator.export_savedmodel` has been renamed to `export_saved_model`.\r\n  * When saving to SavedModel, Estimators will strip default op attributes. This is almost always the correct behavior, as it is more forwards compatible, but if you require that default attributes to be saved with the model, please use `tf.compat.v1.Estimator`.\r\n  * Feature Columns have been upgraded to be more Eager-friendly and to work with Keras. As a result, `tf.feature_column.input_layer` has been deprecated in favor of `tf.keras.layers.DenseFeatures`. v1 feature columns have direct analogues in v2 except for `shared_embedding_columns`, which are not cross-compatible with v1 and v2. Use `tf.feature_column.shared_embeddings` instead.\r\n  \r\n* `tf.keras`:\r\n  * `OMP_NUM_THREADS` is no longer used by the default Keras config.  To configure the number of threads, use `tf.config.threading` APIs.\r\n  * `tf.keras.model.save_model` and `model.save` now defaults to saving a TensorFlow SavedModel. HDF5 files are still supported.\r\n  * Deprecated `tf.keras.experimental.export_saved_model` and `tf.keras.experimental.function`. Please use `tf.keras.models.save_model(..., save_format='tf')` and `tf.keras.models.load_model` instead.\r\n  * Layers now default to float32, and automatically cast their inputs to the layer's dtype. If you had a model that used float64, it will probably silently use float32 in TensorFlow 2, and a warning will be issued that starts with `Layer <layer-name>` is casting an input tensor from dtype float64 to the layer's dtype of float32. To fix, either set the default dtype to float64 with `tf.keras.backend.set_floatx('float64')`, or pass `dtype='float64'` to each of the Layer constructors. See `tf.keras.layers.Layer` for more information.\r\n \r\n* `tf.lite`:\r\n  * Removed `lite.OpHint`, `lite.experimental`, and `lite.constant` from 2.0 API.\r\n* Tensors are no longer hashable, but instead compare element-wise with `==` and `!=`. Use `tf.compat.v1.disable_tensor_equality()` to return to the previous behavior.\r\n* Performing equality operations on Tensors or Variables with incompatible shapes an exception is no longer thrown. Instead `__eq__` returns False and `__ne__` returns True.\r\n* Removed `tf.string_split` from v2 API.\r\n* Deprecated the use of `constraint=` and `.constraint` with ResourceVariable.\r\n* Add `UnifiedGRU` as the new GRU implementation for tf2.0. Change the default recurrent activation function for GRU from `hard_sigmoid` to `sigmoid`, and `reset_after` to True in 2.0. Historically recurrent activation is `hard_sigmoid` since it is fast than 'sigmoid'. With new unified backend between CPU and GPU mode, since the CuDNN kernel is using sigmoid, we change the default for CPU mode to sigmoid as well. With that, the default GRU will be compatible with both CPU and GPU kernel. This will enable user with GPU to use CuDNN kernel by default and get a 10x performance boost in training. Note that this is checkpoint breaking change. If user want to use their 1.x pre-trained checkpoint, please construct the layer with GRU(recurrent_activation='hard_sigmoid', reset_after=False) to fallback to 1.x behavior.\r\n* `CUDNN_INSTALL_PATH`, `TENSORRT_INSTALL_PATH`, `NCCL_INSTALL_PATH`, `NCCL_HDR_PATH` are deprecated. Use `TF_CUDA_PATHS` instead which supports a comma-separated list of base paths that are searched to find CUDA libraries and headers.\r\n\r\nRefer to our [public project status tracker](https://github.com/orgs/tensorflow/projects/4) and [issues tagged with 2.0](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22TF+2.0%22+) on GitHub for insight into recent issues and development progress.\r\n\r\nIf you experience any snags when using TF 2.0, please let us know at the [TF 2.0 Testing User Group](https://groups.google.com/a/tensorflow.org/forum/?utm_medium=email&utm_source=footer#!forum/testing). We have a support mailing list as well as weekly testing meetings, and would love to hear your migration feedback and questions.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Bug Fixes and Other Changes\r\n\r\n* `tf.contrib`:\r\n  * Expose `tf.contrib.proto.*` ops in `tf.io` (they will exist in TF2)\r\n  \r\n* `tf.data`:\r\n  * Add support for TensorArrays to `tf.data Dataset`.\r\n  * Integrate Ragged Tensors with `tf.data`.\r\n  * All core and experimental tf.data transformations that input user-defined functions can span multiple devices now.\r\n  * Extending the TF 2.0 support for `shuffle(..., reshuffle_each_iteration=True)` and `cache()` to work across different Python iterators for the same dataset.\r\n  * Removing the `experimental_numa_aware` option from `tf.data.Options`.\r\n  * Add `num_parallel_reads` and passing in a Dataset containing filenames into `TextLineDataset` and `FixedLengthRecordDataset`.\r\n  * Add support for defaulting the value of `cycle_length` argument of `tf.data.Dataset.interleave` to the number of schedulable CPU cores.\r\n  * Promoting `tf.data.experimental.enumerate_dataset` to core as `tf.data.Dataset.enumerate`.\r\n  * Promoting `tf.data.experimental.unbatch` to core as `tf.data.Dataset.unbatch`.\r\n  * Adds option for introducing slack in the pipeline to reduce CPU contention, via `tf.data.Options().experimental_slack = True`\r\n  * Added experimental support for parallel batching to `batch()` and `padded_batch()`. This functionality can be enabled through `tf.data.Options()`.\r\n  * Support cancellation of long-running `reduce`.\r\n  * Now we use `dataset` node name as prefix instead of the op name, to identify the component correctly in metrics, for pipelines with repeated components.\r\n  * Improve the performance of datasets using `from_tensors()`.\r\n  * Promoting `unbatch` from experimental to core API.\r\n  * Adding support for datasets as inputs to `from_tensors` and `from_tensor_slices` and batching and unbatching of nested datasets.\r\n\r\n* `tf.distribute`:\r\n  * Enable `tf.distribute.experimental.MultiWorkerMirroredStrategy` working in eager mode.\r\n  * Callbacks are supported in `MultiWorkerMirroredStrategy`.\r\n  * Disable `run_eagerly` and distribution strategy if there are symbolic tensors added to the model using `add_metric` or `add_loss`.\r\n  * Loss and gradients should now more reliably be correctly scaled w.r.t. the global batch size when using a `tf.distribute.Strategy`.\r\n  * Set default loss reduction as `AUTO` for improving reliability of loss scaling with distribution strategy and custom training loops. `AUTO` indicates that the reduction option will be determined by the usage context. For almost all cases this defaults to `SUM_OVER_BATCH_SIZE`. When used in distribution strategy scope, outside of built-in training loops such as `tf.keras` `compile` and `fit`, we expect reduction value to be 'None' or 'SUM'. Using other values will raise an error.\r\n  * Support for multi-host `ncclAllReduce` in Distribution Strategy.\r\n\r\n* `tf.estimator`:\r\n  * Replace `tf.contrib.estimator.add_metrics` with `tf.estimator.add_metrics`\r\n  * Use `tf.compat.v1.estimator.inputs` instead of `tf.estimator.inputs`\r\n  * Replace contrib references with `tf.estimator.experimental.*` for apis in early_s in Estimator\r\n  * Canned Estimators will now use keras optimizers by default. An error will be raised if tf.train.Optimizers are used, and you will have to switch to tf.keras.optimizers or tf.compat.v1 canned Estimators.\r\n  * A checkpoint converter for canned Estimators has been provided to transition canned Estimators that are warm started from `tf.train.Optimizers` to `tf.keras.optimizers`.\r\n  * Losses are scaled in canned estimator v2 and not in the optimizers anymore. If you are using Estimator + distribution strategy + optimikzer v1 then the behavior does not change. This implies that if you are using custom estimator with optimizer v2, you have to scale losses. We have new utilities to help scale losses `tf.nn.compute_average_loss`, `tf.nn.scale_regularization_loss`.\r\n\r\n* `tf.keras`:\r\n  * Premade models (including Linear and WideDeep) have been introduced for the purpose of replacing Premade estimators.\r\n  * Model saving changes\r\n  * `model.save` and `tf.saved_model.save` may now save to the TensorFlow SavedModel format. The model can be restored using `tf.keras.models.load_model`. HDF5 files are still supported, and may be used by specifying `save_format=\"h5\"` when saving.\r\n  * Raw TensorFlow functions can now be used in conjunction with the Keras Functional API during model creation. This obviates the need for users to create Lambda layers in most cases when using the Functional API. Like Lambda layers, TensorFlow functions that result in Variable creation or assign ops are not supported.\r\n  * Add support for passing list of lists to the `metrics` argument in Keras `compile`.\r\n  * Add `tf.keras.layers.AbstractRNNCell` as the preferred implementation for RNN cells in TF v2. User can use it to implement RNN cells with custom behavior.\r\n  * Keras training and validation curves are shown on the same plot when using the TensorBoard callback.\r\n  * Switched Keras `fit/evaluate/predict` execution to use only a single unified path by default unless eager execution has been explicitly disabled, regardless of input type. This unified path places an eager-friendly training step inside of a `tf.function`. With this \r\n   1.  All input types are converted to `Dataset`.\r\n   2. The path assumes there is always a distribution strategy. when distribution strategy is not specified the path uses a no-op distribution strategy. \r\n   3. The training step is wrapped in `tf.function` unless `run_eagerly=True` is set in compile. The single path execution code does not yet support all use cases. We fallback to the existing v1 execution paths if your model contains the following: \r\n     1. `sample_weight_mode` in compile \r\n     2. `weighted_metrics` in compile \r\n     3. v1 optimizer \r\n     4. target tensors in compile\r\nIf you are experiencing any issues because of this change, please inform us (file an issue) about your use case and you can unblock yourself by setting `experimental_run_tf_function=False` in compile meanwhile. We have seen couple of use cases where the model usage pattern is not as expected and would not work with this change.\r\n   1. output tensors of one layer is used in the constructor of another.\r\n   2. symbolic tensors outside the scope of the model are used in custom loss functions.\r\n   The flag can be disabled for these cases and ideally the usage pattern will need to be fixed.\r\n  * Mark Keras `set_session` as `compat.v1` only.\r\n  * `tf.keras.estimator.model_to_estimator` now supports exporting to `tf.train.Checkpoint format`, which allows the saved checkpoints to be compatible with `model.load_weights`.\r\n  * `keras.backend.resize_images` (and consequently, `keras.layers.Upsampling2D`) behavior has changed, a bug in the resizing implementation was fixed.\r\n  * Add an `implementation=3` mode for `tf.keras.layers.LocallyConnected2D` and `tf.keras.layers.LocallyConnected1D` layers using `tf.SparseTensor` to store weights,  allowing a dramatic speedup for large sparse models.\r\n  * Raise error if `batch_size` argument is used when input is dataset/generator/keras sequence.\r\n  * Update TF 2.0 `keras.backend.name_scope` to use TF 2.0 `name_scope`.\r\n  * Add v2 module aliases for losses, metrics, initializers and optimizers: `tf.losses = tf.keras.losses` & `tf.metrics = tf.keras.metrics` &  `tf.initializers = tf.keras.initializers` & `tf.optimizers = tf.keras.optimizers`.\r\n  * Updates binary cross entropy logic in Keras when input is probabilities. Instead of converting probabilities to logits, we are using the cross entropy formula for probabilities.\r\n  * Added public APIs for `cumsum` and `cumprod` keras backend functions.\r\n  * Add support for temporal sample weight mode in subclassed models.\r\n  * Raise `ValueError` if an integer is passed to the training APIs. \r\n  * Added fault-tolerance support for training Keras model via `model.fit()` with `MultiWorkerMirroredStrategy`, tutorial available.\r\n  * Custom Callback tutorial is now available.\r\n  * To train with `tf.distribute`, Keras API is recommended over estimator.\r\n  * `steps_per_epoch` and `steps` arguments are supported with numpy arrays.\r\n  * New error message when unexpected keys are used in sample_weight/class_weight dictionaries \r\n  * Losses are scaled in Keras compile/fit and not in the optimizers anymore. If you are using custom training loop, we have new utilities to help scale losses `tf.nn.compute_average_loss`, `tf.nn.scale_regularization_loss`.\r\n  * `Layer` apply and add_variable APIs are deprecated.\r\n  * Added support for channels first data format in cross entropy losses with logits and support for tensors with unknown ranks.\r\n  * Error messages will be raised if `add_update`, `add_metric`, `add_loss`, activity regularizers are used inside of a control flow branch.\r\n  * New loss reduction types: \r\n    1. `AUTO`: Indicates that the reduction option will be determined by the usage context. For almost all cases this defaults to `SUM_OVER_BATCH_SIZE`. When    used with `tf.distribute.Strategy`, outside of built-in training loops such as `tf.keras` `compile` and `fit`, we expect reduction value to be `SUM` or `NONE`. Using `AUTO` in that case will raise an error. \r\n    2. `NONE`: Weighted losses with one dimension reduced (axis=-1, or axis specified by loss function). When this reduction type used with built-in Keras training loops like `fit`/`evaluate`, the unreduced vector loss is passed to the optimizer but the reported loss will be a scalar value. \r\n    3. `SUM`: Scalar sum of weighted losses. 4. `SUM_OVER_BATCH_SIZE`: Scalar `SUM` divided by number of elements in losses. This reduction type is not supported when used with `tf.distribute.Strategy` outside of built-in training loops like `tf.keras` `compile`/`fit`.\r\n  * Wraps losses passed to the `compile` API (strings and v1 losses) which are not instances of v2 `Loss` class in `LossWrapper` class. => All losses will now use `SUM_OVER_BATCH_SIZE` reduction as default.\r\n  * `model.add_loss(symbolic_tensor)` should work in ambient eager.\r\n  * Update metric name to always reflect what the user has given in compile. Affects following cases \r\n    1. When name is given as 'accuracy'/'crossentropy' \r\n    2. When an aliased function name is used eg. 'mse' \r\n    3. Removing the `weighted` prefix from weighted metric names.\r\n  * Allow non-Tensors through v2 losses.\r\n  * Add v2 sparse categorical crossentropy metric.\r\n  * Add v2 APIs for `AUCCurve` and `AUCSummationMethod` enums.\r\n  * `add_update` can now be passed a zero-arg callable in order to support turning off the update when setting `trainable=False` on a Layer of a Model compiled with `run_eagerly=True`.\r\n  * Standardize the LayerNormalization API by replacing the args `norm_axis` and `params_axis` with `axis`.\r\n  * Fixed critical bugs that help with DenseFeatures usability in TF2\r\n\r\n* `tf.lite`:\r\n  * Added evaluation script for `COCO` minival\r\n  * Add delegate support for `QUANTIZE`.\r\n  * Add `GATHER` support to NN API delegate.\r\n  * Added support for TFLiteConverter Python API in 2.0. Contains functions from_saved_model, from_keras_file, and from_concrete_functions.\r\n  * Add `EXPAND_DIMS` support to NN API delegate TEST.\r\n  * Add `narrow_range` attribute to QuantizeAndDequantizeV2 and V3.\r\n  * Added support for `tflite_convert` command line tool in 2.0.\r\n  * Post-training quantization tool supports quantizing weights shared by multiple operations. The models made with versions of this tool will use INT8 types for weights and will only be executable interpreters from this version onwards.\r\n  * Post-training quantization tool supports fp16 weights and GPU delegate acceleration for fp16.\r\n  * Add delegate support for `QUANTIZED_16BIT_LSTM`.\r\n  * Extracts `NNAPIDelegateKernel` from nnapi_delegate.cc\r\n\r\n* TensorRT\r\n  * Add TensorFlow 2.0-compatible `TrtGraphConverterV2` API for TensorRT conversion.\r\n    TensorRT initialization arguments are now passed wrapped in a named-tuple,\r\n    `TrtConversionParams`, rather than as separate arguments as in `TrtGraphConverter`.\r\n  * Changed API to optimize TensorRT enginges during graph optimization. This is now\r\n    done by calling `converter.build()` where previously `is_dynamic_op=False` would\r\n    be set.\r\n  * `converter.convert()` no longer returns a `tf.function`. Now the funtion must be\r\n    accessed from the saved model.\r\n  * The `converter.calibrate()` method has been removed. To trigger calibration, a\r\n    `calibration_input_fn` should be provided to `converter.convert()`.\r\n\r\n* Other:\r\n  * Fix accidental quadratic graph construction cost in graph-mode `tf.gradients()`.\r\n  * ResourceVariable's gather op supports batch dimensions.\r\n  * ResourceVariable support for `gather_nd`.\r\n  * `ResourceVariable` and `Variable` no longer accepts `constraint` in the constructor, nor expose it as a @property.\r\n  * Added gradient for `SparseToDense` op.\r\n  * Expose a flag that allows the number of threads to vary across Python benchmarks.\r\n  * `image.resize` in 2.0 now supports gradients for the new resize kernels.\r\n  * `image.resize` now considers proper pixel centers and has new kernels (incl. anti-aliasing).\r\n  * Renamed `tf.image` functions to remove duplicate \"image\" where it is redundant.\r\n  * Variadic reduce is supported on CPU Variadic reduce is supported on CPU\r\n  * Remove unused `StringViewVariantWrapper`.\r\n  * Delete unused `Fingerprint64Map` op registration\r\n  * Add broadcasting support to `tf.matmul`.\r\n  * Add C++ Gradient for `BatchMatMulV2`.\r\n  * Add `tf.math.cumulative_logsumexp` operation.\r\n  * Add ellipsis (...) support for `tf.einsum()`.\r\n  * Add expand_composites argument to all `nest.*` methods.\r\n  * Added `strings.byte_split`.\r\n  * Add a new \"result_type\" parameter to `tf.strings.split`.\r\n  * Add name argument to `tf.string_split` and `tf.strings_split`.\r\n  * Extend `tf.strings.split` to support inputs with any rank.\r\n  * Added `tf.random.binomial`.\r\n  * Added `key` and `skip` methods to `random.experimental.Generator`.\r\n  * Extend `tf.function` with basic support for CompositeTensors arguments (such as `SparseTensor` and `RaggedTensor`).\r\n  * `parallel_for.pfor`: add converters for Softmax, LogSoftmax, IsNaN, All, Any, and MatrixSetDiag.\r\n  * `parallel_for`: add converters for LowerTriangularSolve and Cholesky.\r\n  * `parallel_for`: add converters for `LogMatrixDeterminant` and `MatrixBandPart`.\r\n  * `parallel_for`: Add converter for `MatrixDiag`.\r\n  * `parallel_for`: Add converters for `OneHot`, `LowerBound`, `UpperBound`.\r\n  * `parallel_for`: add converter for `BroadcastTo`.\r\n  * Add `pfor` converter for `Squeeze`.\r\n  * Add `RaggedTensor.placeholder()`.\r\n  * Add ragged tensor support to `tf.squeeze`.\r\n  * Update RaggedTensors to support int32 row_splits.\r\n  * Allow `LinearOperator.solve` to take a `LinearOperator`.\r\n  * Allow all dtypes for `LinearOperatorCirculant`.\r\n  * Introduce MaxParallelism method\r\n  * Add `LinearOperatorHouseholder`.\r\n  * Adds Philox support to new stateful RNG's XLA path.\r\n  * Added `TensorSpec` support for CompositeTensors.\r\n  * Added `tf.linalg.tridiagonal_solve` op.\r\n  * Added partial_pivoting input parameter to `tf.linalg.tridiagonal_solve`.\r\n  * Added gradient to `tf.linalg.tridiagonal_solve`.\r\n  * Added `tf.linalg.tridiagonal_mul op`.\r\n  * Added GPU implementation of `tf.linalg.tridiagonal_matmul`.\r\n  * Added `LinearOperatorToeplitz`.\r\n  * Upgraded LIBXSMM to version 1.11.\r\n  * Uniform processing of quantized embeddings by Gather and EmbeddingLookup Ops.\r\n  * Correct a misstatement in the documentation of the sparse softmax cross entropy logit parameter.\r\n  * Add `tf.ragged.boolean_mask`.\r\n  * `tf.switch_case` added, which selects a branch_fn based on a branch_index.\r\n  * The C++ kernel of gather op supports batch dimensions.\r\n  * Fixed default value and documentation for `trainable` arg of tf.Variable.\r\n  * `EagerTensor` now supports numpy buffer interface for tensors.\r\n  * This change bumps the version number of the `FullyConnected` Op to 5.\r\n  * Added new op: `tf.strings.unsorted_segment_join`.\r\n  * Added HW acceleration support for `topK_v2`.\r\n  * CloudBigtable version updated to v0.10.0

failure leaves interpreter in valid state\r\n  * `tf.while_loop` emits a StatelessWhile op if the cond and body functions are stateless and do not touch any resources.\r\n  * `tf.cond`, `tf.while` and if and while in AutoGraph now accept a nonscalar predicate if has a single element. This does not affect non-V2 control flow.\r\n  * Fix potential security vulnerability where decoding variant tensors from proto could result in heap out of bounds memory access.\r\n  * Only create a GCS directory object if the object does not already exist.\r\n  * Introduce `dynamic` constructor argument in Layer and Model, which should be set to `True` when using imperative control flow in the `call` method.\r\n  * Begin adding Go wrapper for C Eager API.\r\n  * XLA HLO graphs can be inspected with interactive_graphviz tool now.\r\n  * Add dataset ops to the graph (or create kernels in Eager execution) during the python Dataset object creation instead doing it during Iterator creation time.\r\n  * Add `batch_dims` argument to `tf.gather`.\r\n  * The behavior of `tf.gather` is now correct when `axis=None` and `batch_dims<0`.\r\n  * Update docstring for gather to properly describe the non-empty `batch_dims` case.\r\n  * Removing of dtype in the constructor of initializers and partition_info in call.\r\n  * Add `tf.math.nextafter` op.\r\n  * Turn on MKL-DNN contraction kernels by default. MKL-DNN dynamically dispatches the best kernel implementation based on CPU vector architecture. To disable them, build with `--define=tensorflow_mkldnn_contraction_kernel=0`.\r\n  * `tf.linspace(start, stop, num)` now always uses \"stop\" as last value (for num > 1)\r\n  * Added top-k to precision and recall to keras metrics.\r\n  * Add a ragged size op and register it to the op dispatcher\r\n  * Transitive dependencies on :`pooling_ops` were removed.

    "body": "# Release 2.0.0-rc2\r\n\r\n## Major Features and Improvements\r\n\r\nTensorFlow 2.0 focuses on **simplicity** and **ease of use**, featuring updates like:\r\n\r\n* Easy model building with Keras and eager execution.\r\n* Robust model deployment in production on any platform.\r\n* Powerful experimentation for research.\r\n* API simplification by reducing duplication and removing deprecated endpoints.\r\n\r\nFor details on best practices with 2.0, see [the Effective 2.0 guide](https://www.tensorflow.org/beta/guide/effective_tf2)\r\n\r\n\r\nFor information on upgrading your existing TensorFlow 1.x models, please refer to our [Upgrade](https://medium.com/tensorflow/upgrading-your-code-to-tensorflow-2-0-f72c3a4d83b5) and [Migration](https://www.tensorflow.org/beta/guide/migration_guide) guides. We have also released a collection of [tutorials and getting started guides](https://www.tensorflow.org/beta).\r\n\r\n## Highlights\r\n\r\n* TF 2.0 delivers Keras as the central high level API used to build and train models. Keras provides several model-building APIs such as Sequential, Functional, and Subclassing along with eager execution, for immediate iteration and intuitive debugging, and tf.data, for building scalable input pipelines. Checkout [guide](https://www.tensorflow.org/beta/guide/keras/overview) for additional details.\r\n* Distribution Strategy: TF 2.0 users will be able to use the [`tf.distribute.Strategy`](https://www.tensorflow.org/beta/guide/distribute_strategy) API to distribute training with minimal code changes, yielding great out-of-the-box performance. It supports distributed training with Keras model.fit, as well as with custom training loops. Multi-GPU support is available, along with experimental support for multi worker and Cloud TPUs. Check out the [guide](https://www.tensorflow.org/beta/guide/distribute_strategy) for more details.\r\n* Functions, not Sessions. The traditional declarative programming model of building a graph and executing it via a `tf.Session` is discouraged, and replaced by writing regular Python functions. Using the `tf.function` decorator, such functions can be turned into graphs which can be executed remotely, serialized, and optimized for performance.\r\n* Unification of tf.train.Optimizers and tf.keras.Optimizers. Use tf.keras.Optimizers for TF2.0. `compute_gradients` is removed as public API, and use GradientTape to compute gradients.\r\n* AutoGraph translates Python control flow into TensorFlow expressions, allowing users to write regular Python inside `tf.function`-decorated functions. AutoGraph is also applied in functions used with tf.data, tf.distribute and tf.keras APIs. \r\n* Unification of exchange formats to SavedModel. All TensorFlow ecosystem projects (TensorFlow Lite, TensorFlow JS, TensorFlow Serving, TensorFlow Hub) accept SavedModels. Model state should be saved to and restored from SavedModels.\r\n* API Changes: Many API symbols have been renamed or removed, and argument names have changed. Many of these changes are motivated by consistency and clarity. The 1.x API remains available in the compat.v1 module. A list of all symbol changes can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FLFJLzg7WNP6JHODX5q8BDgptKafq_slHpnHVbJIteQ/edit#gid=0). \r\n * API clean-up, included removing `tf.app`, `tf.flags`, and `tf.logging` in favor of [absl-py](https://github.com/abseil/abseil-py).\r\n* No more global variables with helper methods like `tf.global_variables_initializer` and `tf.get_global_step`.\r\n* Add toggles `tf.enable_control_flow_v2()` and `tf.disable_control_flow_v2()` for enabling/disabling v2 control flow.\r\n* Enable v2 control flow as part of `tf.enable_v2_behavior()` and `TF2_BEHAVIOR=1`.\r\n* Fixes autocomplete for most TensorFlow API references by switching to use relative imports in API `__init__.py` files.\r\n* Auto Mixed-Precision graph optimizer simplifies converting models to float16 for acceleration on Volta and Turing Tensor Cores. This feature can be enabled by wrapping an optimizer class with `tf.train.experimental.enable_mixed_precision_graph_rewrite()`.\r\n* Add environment variable `TF_CUDNN_DETERMINISTIC`. Setting to \"true\" or \"1\" forces the selection of deterministic cuDNN convolution and max-pooling algorithms. When this is enabled, the algorithm selection procedure itself is also deterministic.\r\n\r\n## Breaking Changes\r\n* Many backwards incompatible API changes have been made to clean up the APIs and make them more consistent.\r\n* Toolchains:\r\n  * TensorFlow 2.0.0 is built using devtoolset7 (GCC7) on Ubuntu 16. This may lead to ABI incompatibilities with extensions built against earlier versions of TensorFlow.\r\n  * Tensorflow code now produces 2 different pip packages: tensorflow_core containing all the code (in the future it will contain only the private implementation) and tensorflow which is a virtual pip package doing forwarding to tensorflow_core (and in the future will contain only the public API of tensorflow). We don't expect this to be breaking, unless you were importing directly from the implementation.\r\n\r\n* `tf.contrib`:\r\n  * `tf.contrib` has been deprecated, and functionality has been either migrated to the core TensorFlow API, to an ecosystem project such as [tensorflow/addons](https://www.github.com/tensorflow/addons) or [tensorflow/io](https://www.github.com/tensorflow/io), or removed entirely.\r\n  * Remove `tf.contrib.timeseries` dependency on TF distributions.\r\n  * Replace contrib references with `tf.estimator.experimental.*` for apis in early_stopping.py.\r\n\r\n* `tf.estimator`:\r\n  * Premade estimators in the tf.estimator.DNN/Linear/DNNLinearCombined family have been updated to use `tf.keras.optimizers` instead of the `tf.compat.v1.train.Optimizer`s. If you do not pass in an `optimizer=` arg or if you use a string, the premade estimator will use the Keras optimizer. This is checkpoint breaking, as the optimizers have separate variables. A checkpoint converter tool for converting optimizers is included with the release,  but if you want to avoid any change, switch to the v1 version of the estimator:  `tf.compat.v1.estimator.DNN/Linear/DNNLinearCombined*`.\r\n  * Default aggregation for canned Estimators is now `SUM_OVER_BATCH_SIZE`. To maintain previous default behavior, please pass `SUM` as the loss aggregation method.\r\n  * Canned Estimators don’t support `input_layer_partitioner` arg in the API. If you have this arg, you will have to switch to `tf.compat.v1 canned Estimators`.\r\n  * `Estimator.export_savedmodel` has been renamed `export_saved_model`.\r\n  * When saving to SavedModel, Estimators will strip default op attributes. This is almost always the correct behavior, as it is more forwards compatible, but if you require that default attributes are saved with the model, please use `tf.compat.v1.Estimator`.\r\n  * Feature Columns have been upgraded to be more Eager-friendly and to work with Keras. As a result, `tf.feature_column.input_layer` has been deprecated in favor of `tf.keras.layers.DenseFeatures`. v1 feature columns have direct analogues in v2 except for `shared_embedding_columns`, which are not cross-compatible with v1 and v2. Use `tf.feature_column.shared_embeddings` instead.\r\n\r\n* `tf.keras`:\r\n  * `OMP_NUM_THREADS` is no longer used by the default Keras config.  To configure the number of threads, use `tf.config.threading` APIs.\r\n  * `tf.keras.model.save_model` and `model.save` now defaults to saving a TensorFlow SavedModel. HDF5 files are still supported.\r\n  * Deprecated `tf.keras.experimental.export_saved_model` and `tf.keras.experimental.function`. Please use `tf.keras.models.save_model(..., save_format='tf')` and `tf.keras.models.load_model` instead.\r\n  * Layers now default to float32, and automatically cast their inputs to the layer's dtype. If you had a model that used float64, it will probably silently use float32 in TensorFlow 2, and a warning will be issued that starts with \"Layer <layer-name> is casting an input tensor from dtype float64 to the layer's dtype of float32\". To fix, either set the default dtype to float64 with `tf.keras.backend.set_floatx('float64')`, or pass `dtype='float64'` to each of the Layer constructors. See `tf.keras.layers.Layer` for more information.\r\n\r\n* `tf.lite`:\r\n  * Removed `lite.OpHint`, `lite.experimental`, and `lite.constant` from 2.0 API.\r\n\r\n* Tensors are no longer hashable, but instead compare element-wise with `==` and `!=`. Use `tf.compat.v1.disable_tensor_equality()` to return to the previous behavior.\r\n* Performing equality operations on Tensors or Variables with incompatible shapes an exception is no longer thrown. Instead `__eq__` returns False and `__ne__` returns True.\r\n* Removed `tf.string_split` from v2 API.\r\n* Deprecated the use of `constraint=` and `.constraint` with ResourceVariable.\r\n* Add `UnifiedGRU` as the new GRU implementation for tf2.0. Change the default recurrent activation function for GRU from `hard_sigmoid` to `sigmoid`, and `reset_after` to True in 2.0. Historically recurrent activation is `hard_sigmoid` since it is fast than 'sigmoid'. With new unified backend between CPU and GPU mode, since the CuDNN kernel is using sigmoid, we change the default for CPU mode to sigmoid as well. With that, the default GRU will be compatible with both CPU and GPU kernel. This will enable user with GPU to use CuDNN kernel by default and get a 10x performance boost in training. Note that this is checkpoint breaking change. If user want to use their 1.x pre-trained checkpoint, please construct the layer with GRU(recurrent_activation='hard_sigmoid', reset_after=False) to fallback to 1.x behavior.\r\n* `CUDNN_INSTALL_PATH`, `TENSORRT_INSTALL_PATH`, `NCCL_INSTALL_PATH`, `NCCL_HDR_PATH` are deprecated. Use `TF_CUDA_PATHS` instead which supports a comma-separated list of base paths that are searched to find CUDA libraries and headers.\r\n\r\nRefer to our [public project status tracker](https://github.com/orgs/tensorflow/projects/4) and [issues tagged with `2.0`](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A2.0) on GitHub for insight into recent issues and development progress.\r\n\r\nIf you experience any snags when using TF 2.0, please let us know at the [TF 2.0 Testing User Group](https://groups.google.com/a/tensorflow.org/forum/?utm_medium=email&utm_source=footer#!forum/testing). We have a support mailing list as well as weekly testing meetings, and would love to hear your migration feedback and questions.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Bug Fixes and Other Changes\r\n\r\n* `tf.contrib`:\r\n  * Expose `tf.contrib.proto.*` ops in `tf.io` (they will exist in TF2)\r\n  \r\n* `tf.data`:\r\n  * Add support for TensorArrays to `tf.data Dataset`.\r\n  * Integrate Ragged Tensors with `tf.data`.\r\n  * All core and experimental tf.data transformations that input user-defined functions can span multiple devices now.\r\n  * Extending the TF 2.0 support for `shuffle(..., reshuffle_each_iteration=True)` and `cache()` to work across different Python iterators for the same dataset.\r\n  * Removing the `experimental_numa_aware` option from `tf.data.Options`.\r\n  * Add `num_parallel_reads` and passing in a Dataset containing filenames into `TextLineDataset` and `FixedLengthRecordDataset`.\r\n  * Add support for defaulting the value of `cycle_length` argument of `tf.data.Dataset.interleave` to the number of schedulable CPU cores.\r\n  * Promoting `tf.data.experimental.enumerate_dataset` to core as `tf.data.Dataset.enumerate`.\r\n  * Promoting `tf.data.experimental.unbatch` to core as `tf.data.Dataset.unbatch`.\r\n  * Adds option for introducing slack in the pipeline to reduce CPU contention, via `tf.data.Options().experimental_slack = True`\r\n  * Added experimental support for parallel batching to `batch()` and `padded_batch()`. This functionality can be enabled through tf.data.Options()\r\n  * Support cancellation of long-running `reduce`.\r\n  * Now we use `dataset` node name as prefix instead of the op name, to identify the component correctly in metrics, for pipelines with repeated components.\r\n  * Improve the performance of datasets using `from_tensors()`.\r\n  * Promoting `unbatch` from experimental to core API.\r\n  * Adding support for datasets as inputs to `from_tensors` and `from_tensor_slices` and batching and unbatching of nested datasets.\r\n\r\n* `tf.distribute`:\r\n  * Enable `tf.distribute.experimental.MultiWorkerMirroredStrategy` working in eager mode.\r\n  * Callbacks are supported in `MultiWorkerMirroredStrategy`.\r\n  * Disable `run_eagerly` and distribution strategy if there are symbolic tensors added to the model using `add_metric` or `add_loss`.\r\n  * Loss and gradients should now more reliably be correctly scaled w.r.t. the global batch size when using a `tf.distribute.Strategy`.\r\n  * Set default loss reduction as `AUTO` for improving reliability of loss scaling with distribution strategy and custom training loops. `AUTO` indicates that the reduction option will be determined by the usage context. For almost all cases this defaults to `SUM_OVER_BATCH_SIZE`. When used in distribution strategy scope, outside of built-in training loops such as `tf.keras` `compile` and `fit`, we expect reduction value to be 'None' or 'SUM'. Using other values will raise an error.\r\n  * Support for multi-host `ncclAllReduce` in Distribution Strategy.\r\n\r\n* `tf.estimator`:\r\n  * Replace `tf.contrib.estimator.add_metrics` with `tf.estimator.add_metrics`\r\n  * Use `tf.compat.v1.estimator.inputs` instead of `tf.estimator.inputs`\r\n  * Replace contrib references with `tf.estimator.experimental.*` for apis in early_s in Estimator\r\n  * Canned Estimators will now use keras optimizers by default. An error will be raised if tf.train.Optimizers are used, and you will have to switch to tf.keras.optimizers or tf.compat.v1 canned Estimators.\r\n  * A checkpoint converter for canned Estimators has been provided to transition canned Estimators that are warm started from `tf.train.Optimizers` to `tf.keras.optimizers`.\r\n  * Losses are scaled in canned estimator v2 and not in the optimizers anymore. If you are using Estimator + distribution strategy + optimikzer v1 then the behavior does not change. This implies that if you are using custom estimator with optimizer v2, you have to scale losses. We have new utilities to help scale losses `tf.nn.compute_average_loss`, `tf.nn.scale_regularization_loss`.\r\n\r\n* `tf.keras`:\r\n  * Premade models (including Linear and WideDeep) have been introduced for the purpose of replacing Premade estimators.\r\n  * Model saving changes\r\n  * `model.save` and `tf.saved_model.save` may now save to the TensorFlow SavedModel format. The model can be restored using `tf.keras.models.load_model`. HDF5 files are still supported, and may be used by specifying `save_format=\"h5\"` when saving.\r\n  * Raw TensorFlow functions can now be used in conjunction with the Keras Functional API during model creation. This obviates the need for users to create Lambda layers in most cases when using the Functional API. Like Lambda layers, TensorFlow functions that result in Variable creation or assign ops are not supported.\r\n  * Add support for passing list of lists to the `metrics` argument in Keras `compile`.\r\n  * Add `tf.keras.layers.AbstractRNNCell` as the preferred implementation for RNN cells in TF v2. User can use it to implement RNN cells with custom behavior.\r\n  * Keras training and validation curves are shown on the same plot when using the TensorBoard callback.\r\n  * Switched Keras `fit/evaluate/predict` execution to use only a single unified path by default unless eager execution has been explicitly disabled, regardless of input type. This unified path places an eager-friendly training step inside of a `tf.function`. With this\r\n    1.  All input types are converted to `Dataset`.\r\n    2. The path assumes there is always a distribution strategy, when distribution strategy is not specified the path uses a no-op distribution strategy. \r\n    3. The training step is wrapped in `tf.function` unless `run_eagerly=True` is set in compile. The single path execution code does not yet support all use cases. We fallback to the existing v1 execution paths if your model contains the following: \r\n       1. `sample_weight_mode` in compile \r\n       2. `weighted_metrics` in compile \r\n       3. v1 optimizer \r\n       4. target tensors in compile.  \r\n    4. If you are experiencing any issues because of this change, please inform us (file an issue) about your use case and you can unblock yourself by setting `experimental_run_tf_function=False` in compile meanwhile. We have seen couple of use cases where the model usage pattern is not as expected and would not work with this change. \r\n       1. output tensors of one layer is used in the constructor of another. \r\n       2. symbolic tensors outside the scope of the model are used in custom loss functions.\r\nThe flag can be disabled for these cases and ideally the usage pattern will need to be fixed.\r\n  * Mark Keras `set_session` as `compat.v1` only.\r\n  * `tf.keras.estimator.model_to_estimator` now supports exporting to `tf.train.Checkpoint format`, which allows the saved checkpoints to be compatible with `model.load_weights`.\r\n  * `keras.backend.resize_images` (and consequently, `keras.layers.Upsampling2D`) behavior has changed, a bug in the resizing implementation was fixed.\r\n  * Add an `implementation=3` mode for `tf.keras.layers.LocallyConnected2D` and `tf.keras.layers.LocallyConnected1D` layers using `tf.SparseTensor` to store weights,  allowing a dramatic speedup for large sparse models.\r\n  * Raise error if `batch_size` argument is used when input is dataset/generator/keras sequence.\r\n  * Update TF 2.0 `keras.backend.name_scope` to use TF 2.0 `name_scope`.\r\n  * Add v2 module aliases for losses, metrics, initializers and optimizers: `tf.losses = tf.keras.losses` & `tf.metrics = tf.keras.metrics` &  `tf.initializers = tf.keras.initializers` & `tf.optimizers = tf.keras.optimizers`.\r\n  * Updates binary cross entropy logic in Keras when input is probabilities. Instead of converting probabilities to logits, we are using the cross entropy formula for probabilities.\r\n  * Added public APIs for `cumsum` and `cumprod` keras backend functions.\r\n  * Add support for temporal sample weight mode in subclassed models.\r\n  * Raise ValueError if an integer is passed to the training APIs. \r\n  * Added fault-tolerance support for training Keras model via `model.fit()` with `MultiWorkerMirroredStrategy`, tutorial available.\r\n  * Custom Callback tutorial is now available.\r\n  * To train with `tf.distribute`, Keras api is recommended over estimator.\r\n  * `steps_per_epoch` and `steps` arguments are supported with numpy arrays.\r\n  * New error message when unexpected keys are used in sample_weight/class_weight dictionaries \r\n  * Losses are scaled in Keras compile/fit and not in the optimizers anymore. If you are using custom training loop, we have new utilities to help scale losses `tf.nn.compute_average_loss`, `tf.nn.scale_regularization_loss`.\r\n  * `Layer` apply and add_variable APIs are deprecated.\r\n  * Added support for channels first data format in cross entropy losses with logits and support for tensors with unknown ranks.\r\n  * Error messages will be raised if `add_update`, `add_metric`, `add_loss`, activity regularizers are used inside of a control flow branch.\r\n  * New loss reduction types: \r\n    1. `AUTO`: Indicates that the reduction option will be determined by the usage context. For almost all cases this defaults to `SUM_OVER_BATCH_SIZE`. When    used with `tf.distribute.Strategy`, outside of built-in training loops such as `tf.keras` `compile` and `fit`, we expect reduction value to be `SUM` or `NONE`. Using `AUTO` in that case will raise an error. \r\n    2. `NONE`: Weighted losses with one dimension reduced (axis=-1, or axis specified by loss function). When this reduction type used with built-in Keras training loops like `fit`/`evaluate`, the unreduced vector loss is passed to the optimizer but the reported loss will be a scalar value. \r\n    3. `SUM`: Scalar sum of weighted losses. 4. `SUM_OVER_BATCH_SIZE`: Scalar `SUM` divided by number of elements in losses. This reduction type is not supported when used with `tf.distribute.Strategy` outside of built-in training loops like `tf.keras` `compile`/`fit`.\r\n  * Wraps losses passed to the `compile` API (strings and v1 losses) which are not instances of v2 `Loss` class in `LossWrapper` class. => All losses will now use `SUM_OVER_BATCH_SIZE` reduction as default.\r\n  * `model.add_loss(symbolic_tensor)` should work in ambient eager.\r\n  * Update metric name to always reflect what the user has given in compile. Affects following cases \r\n    1. When name is given as 'accuracy'/'crossentropy' \r\n    2. When an aliased function name is used eg. 'mse' \r\n    3. Removing the `weighted` prefix from weighted metric names.\r\n  * Allow non-Tensors through v2 losses.\r\n  * Add v2 sparse categorical crossentropy metric.\r\n  * Add v2 APIs for `AUCCurve` and `AUCSummationMethod` enums.\r\n  * `add_update` can now be passed a zero-arg callable in order to support turning off the update when setting `trainable=False` on a Layer of a Model compiled with `run_eagerly=True`.\r\n  * Standardize the LayerNormalization API by replacing the args `norm_axis` and `params_axis` with `axis`.\r\n  * Fixed critical bugs that help with DenseFeatures usability in TF2\r\n\r\n* `tf.lite`:\r\n  * Added evaluation script for `COCO` minival\r\n  * Add delegate support for `QUANTIZE`.\r\n  * Add `GATHER` support to NN API delegate.\r\n  * Added support for TFLiteConverter Python API in 2.0. Contains functions from_saved_model, from_keras_file, and from_concrete_functions.\r\n  * Add `EXPAND_DIMS` support to NN API delegate TEST.\r\n  * Add `narrow_range` attribute to QuantizeAndDequantizeV2 and V3.\r\n  * Added support for `tflite_convert` command line tool in 2.0.\r\n  * Post-training quantization tool supports quantizing weights shared by multiple operations. The models made with versions of this tool will use INT8 types for weights and will only be executable interpreters from this version onwards.\r\n  * Post-training quantization tool supports fp16 weights and GPU delegate acceleration for fp16.\r\n  * Add delegate support for `QUANTIZED_16BIT_LSTM`.\r\n  * Extracts `NNAPIDelegateKernel` from nnapi_delegate.cc\r\n\r\n* TensorRT\r\n  * Add TensorFlow 2.0-compatible `TrtGraphConverterV2` API for TensorRT conversion. TensorRT initialization arguments are now passed wrapped in a named-tuple,`TrtConversionParams`, rather than as separate arguments as in `TrtGraphConverter`.\r\n  * Changed API to optimize TensorRT engines during graph optimization. This is nowdone by calling `converter.build()` where previously `is_dynamic_op=False` would be set.\r\n  * `converter.convert()` no longer returns a `tf.function`. Now the function must beaccessed from the saved model.\r\n  * The `converter.calibrate()` method has been removed. To trigger calibration, a`calibration_input_fn` should be provided to `converter.convert()`.\r\n  \r\n* Other:\r\n  * Fix accidental quadratic graph construction cost in graph-mode `tf.gradients()`.\r\n  * ResourceVariable's gather op supports batch dimensions.\r\n  * ResourceVariable support for `gather_nd`.\r\n  * `ResourceVariable` and `Variable` no longer accepts `constraint` in the constructor, nor expose it as a @property.\r\n  * Added gradient for `SparseToDense` op.\r\n  * Expose a flag that allows the number of threads to vary across Python benchmarks.\r\n  * `image.resize` in 2.0 now supports gradients for the new resize kernels.\r\n  * `image.resize` now considers proper pixel centers and has new kernels (incl. anti-aliasing).\r\n  *

    "body": "# Release 1.15.0-rc1\r\nThis is the last 1.x release for TensorFlow. We do not expect to update the 1.x branch with features, although we will issue patch releases to fix vulnerabilities for at least one year. \r\n\r\n## Major Features and Improvements\r\n* As [announced](https://groups.google.com/a/tensorflow.org/forum/#!topic/developers/iRCt5m4qUz0), `tensorflow` pip package will by default include GPU support (same as `tensorflow-gpu` now) for the platforms we currently have GPU support (Linux and Windows). It will work on machines with and without Nvidia GPUs. `tensorflow-gpu` will still be available, and CPU-only packages can be downloaded at `tensorflow-cpu` for users who are concerned about package size.\r\n* TensorFlow 1.15 contains a complete implementation of the 2.0 API in its `compat.v2 module`. It contains a copy of the 1.15 main module (without `contrib`) in the `compat.v1 module`. TensorFlow 1.15 is able to emulate 2.0 behavior using the `enable_v2_behavior()` function.\r\nThis enables writing forward compatible code: by explicitly importing either `tensorflow.compat.v1` or `tensorflow.compat.v2`, you can ensure that your code works without modifications against an installation of 1.15 or 2.0.\r\n* EagerTensor now supports numpy buffer interface for tensors.\r\n* Add toggles `tf.enable_control_flow_v2()` and `tf.disable_control_flow_v2()` for enabling/disabling v2 control flow.\r\n* Enable v2 control flow as part of `tf.enable_v2_behavior()` and `TF2_BEHAVIOR=1`.\r\n* AutoGraph translates Python control flow into TensorFlow expressions, allowing users to write regular Python inside `tf.function`-decorated functions. AutoGraph is also applied in functions used with `tf.data`, `tf.distribute` and `tf.keras` APIS.\r\n* Adds `enable_tensor_equality()`, which switches the behavior such that: \r\n  * Tensors are no longer hashable.\r\n  * Tensors can be compared with == and !=, yielding a Boolean Tensor with element-wise comparison results. This will be the default behavior in 2.0.\r\n* Auto Mixed-Precision graph optimizer simplifies converting models to float16 for acceleration on Volta and Turing Tensor Cores. This feature can be enabled by wrapping an optimizer class with `tf.train.experimental.enable_mixed_precision_graph_rewrite()`.\r\n* Add environment variable `TF_CUDNN_DETERMINISTIC`. Setting to \"true\" or \"1\" forces the selection of deterministic cuDNN convolution and max-pooling algorithms. When this is enabled, the algorithm selection procedure itself is also deterministic.\r\n* TensorRT\r\n  * Migrate TensorRT conversion sources from contrib to compiler directory in preparation for TF 2.0.\r\n  * Add additional, user friendly `TrtGraphConverter` API for TensorRT conversion.\r\n  * Expand support for TensorFlow operators in TensorRT conversion (e.g.\r\n    `Gather`, `Slice`, `Pack`, `Unpack`, `ArgMin`, `ArgMax`,`DepthSpaceShuffle`). \r\n  * Support TensorFlow operator `CombinedNonMaxSuppression` in TensorRT conversion which \r\n     significantly accelerates object detection models.\r\n\r\n## Breaking Changes\r\n* Tensorflow code now produces 2 different pip packages: tensorflow_core containing all the code (in the future it will contain only the private implementation) and tensorflow which is a virtual pip package doing forwarding to tensorflow_core (and in the future will contain only the public API of tensorflow). We don't expect this to be breaking, unless you were importing directly from the implementation.\r\n* TensorFlow 1.15 is built using devtoolset7 (GCC7) on Ubuntu 16. This may lead to ABI incompatibilities with extensions built against earlier versions of TensorFlow.\r\n* Deprecated the use of `constraint=` and `.constraint` with ResourceVariable.\r\n* `tf.keras`:\r\n  * `OMP_NUM_THREADS` is no longer used by the default Keras config. To configure the number of threads, use `tf.config.threading` APIs.\r\n  * `tf.keras.model.save_model` and `model.save` now defaults to saving a TensorFlow SavedModel.\r\n  * `keras.backend.resize_images` (and consequently, `keras.layers.Upsampling2D`) behavior has changed, a bug in the resizing implementation was fixed.\r\n  * Layers now default to `float32`, and automatically cast their inputs to the layer's dtype. If you had a model that used `float64`, it will probably silently use `float32` in TensorFlow2, and a warning will be issued that starts with Layer \"layer-name\" is casting an input tensor from dtype float64 to the layer's dtype of float32. To fix, either set the default dtype to float64 with `tf.keras.backend.set_floatx('float64')`, or pass `dtype='float64'` to each of the Layer constructors. See `tf.keras.layers.Layer` for more information.\r\n  * Some `tf.assert_*` methods now raise assertions at operation creation time (i.e. when this Python line executes) if the input tensors' values are known at that time, not during the session.run(). When this happens, a noop is returned and the input tensors are marked non-feedable. In other words, if they are used as keys in `feed_dict` argument to `session.run()`, an error will be raised. Also, because some assert ops don't make it into the graph, the graph structure changes. A different graph can result in different per-op random seeds when they are not given explicitly (most often).\r\n\r\n## Bug Fixes and Other Changes\r\n* `tf.estimator`:\r\n  * `tf.keras.estimator.model_to_estimator` now supports exporting to `tf.train.Checkpoint` format, which allows the saved checkpoints to be compatible with `model.load_weights`.\r\n  * Fix tests in canned estimators.\r\n  * Expose Head as public API.\r\n  * Fixes critical bugs that help with `DenseFeatures` usability in TF2\r\n* `tf.data`:\r\n  * Promoting `unbatch` from experimental to core API.\r\n  * Adding support for datasets as inputs to `from_tensors` and `from_tensor_slices` and batching and unbatching of nested datasets.\r\n* `tf.keras`:\r\n  * `tf.keras.estimator.model_to_estimator` now supports exporting to tf.train.Checkpoint format, which allows the saved checkpoints to be compatible with `model.load_weights`.\r\n  * Saving a Keras Model using `tf.saved_model.save` now saves the list of variables, trainable variables, regularization losses, and the call function.\r\n  * Deprecated `tf.keras.experimental.export_saved_model` and `tf.keras.experimental.function`. Please use `tf.keras.models.save_model(..., save_format='tf')` and `tf.keras.models.load_model` instead.\r\n  * Add an `implementation=3` mode for `tf.keras.layers.LocallyConnected2D` and `tf.keras.layers.LocallyConnected1D` layers using `tf.SparseTensor` to store weights,  allowing a dramatic speedup for large sparse models.\r\n  * Enable the Keras compile API `experimental_run_tf_function` flag by default. This flag enables single training/eval/predict execution path. With this 1. All input types are converted to `Dataset`. 2. When distribution strategy is not specified this goes through the no-op distribution strategy path. 3. Execution is wrapped in tf.function unless `run_eagerly=True` is set in compile.\r\n  * Raise error if `batch_size` argument is used when input is dataset/generator/keras sequence.\r\n* `tf.lite`\r\n  * Add `GATHER` support to NN API delegate.\r\n  * tflite object detection script has a debug mode.\r\n  * Add delegate support for `QUANTIZE`.\r\n  * Added evaluation script for COCO minival.\r\n  * Add delegate support for `QUANTIZED_16BIT_LSTM`.\r\n  * Converts hardswish subgraphs into atomic ops.\r\n* Add support for defaulting the value of `cycle_length` argument of `tf.data.Dataset.interleave` to the number of schedulable CPU cores.\r\n* `parallel_for`: Add converter for `MatrixDiag`.\r\n* Add `narrow_range` attribute to `QuantizeAndDequantizeV2` and V3.\r\n* Added new op: `tf.strings.unsorted_segment_join`.\r\n* Add HW acceleration support for `topK_v2`.\r\n* Add new `TypeSpec` classes.\r\n* CloudBigtable version updated to v0.10.0.\r\n* Expose `Head` as public API.\r\n* Update docstring for gather to properly describe the non-empty `batch_dims` case.\r\n* Added `tf.sparse.from_dense` utility function.\r\n* Improved ragged tensor support in `TensorFlowTestCase`.\r\n* Makes the a-normal form transformation in Pyct configurable as to which nodes are converted to variables and which are not.\r\n* `ResizeInputTensor` now works for all delegates.\r\n* Add `EXPAND_DIMS` support to NN API delegate TEST:  expand_dims_test\r\n* `tf.cond` emits a StatelessIf op if the branch functions are stateless and do not touch any resources.\r\n* `tf.cond`, `tf.while` and `if` and `while` in AutoGraph now accept a nonscalar predicate if has a single element. This does not affect non-V2 control flow.\r\n* `tf.while_loop` emits a StatelessWhile op if the cond and body functions are stateless and do not touch any resources.\r\n* Refactors code in Quant8 LSTM support to reduce TFLite binary size.\r\n* Add support of local soft device placement for eager op.\r\n* Add HW acceleration support for `LogSoftMax`.\r\n* Added a function `nested_value_rowids` for ragged tensors.\r\n* Add guard to avoid acceleration of L2 Normalization with input rank != 4\r\n* Add `tf.math.cumulative_logsumexp operation`.\r\n* Add `tf.ragged.stack`.\r\n* Fix memory allocation problem when calling `AddNewInputConstantTensor`.\r\n* Delegate application failure leaves interpreter in valid state.\r\n* Add check for correct memory alignment to `MemoryAllocation::MemoryAllocation()`.\r\n* Extracts `NNAPIDelegateKernel` from nnapi_delegate.cc\r\n* Added support for `FusedBatchNormV3` in converter.\r\n* A ragged to dense op for directly calculating tensors.\r\n* Fix accidental quadratic graph construction cost in graph-mode `tf.gradients()`.\r\n* The `precision_mode` argument to `TrtGraphConverter` is now case insensitive.\r\n\r\n## Thanks to our Contributors\r\n\r\nThis release contains contributions from many people at Google, as well as:\r\n\r\na6802739, Aaron Ma, Abdullah Selek, Abolfazl Shahbazi, Ag Ramesh, Albert Z.

    "body": "# Release 2.0.0-rc1\r\n\r\n## Major Features and Improvements\r\n\r\nTensorFlow 2.0 focuses on **simplicity** and **ease of use**, featuring updates like:\r\n\r\n* Easy model building with Keras and eager execution.\r\n* Robust model deployment in production on any platform.\r\n* Powerful experimentation for research.\r\n* API simplification by reducing duplication and removing deprecated endpoints.\r\n\r\nFor details on best practices with 2.0, see [the Effective 2.0 guide](https://www.tensorflow.org/beta/guide/effective_tf2)\r\n\r\n\r\nFor information on upgrading your existing TensorFlow 1.x models, please refer to our [Upgrade](https://medium.com/tensorflow/upgrading-your-code-to-tensorflow-2-0-f72c3a4d83b5) and [Migration](https://www.tensorflow.org/beta/guide/migration_guide) guides. We have also released a collection of [tutorials and getting started guides](https://www.tensorflow.org/beta).\r\n\r\n## Highlights\r\n\r\n* TF 2.0 delivers Keras as the central high level API used to build and train models. Keras provides several model-building APIs such as Sequential, Functional, and Subclassing along with eager execution, for immediate iteration and intuitive debugging, and tf.data, for building scalable input pipelines. Checkout [guide](https://www.tensorflow.org/beta/guide/keras/overview) for additional details.\r\n* Distribution Strategy: TF 2.0 users will be able to use the [`tf.distribute.Strategy`](https://www.tensorflow.org/beta/guide/distribute_strategy) API to distribute training with minimal code changes, yielding great out-of-the-box performance. It supports distributed training with Keras model.fit, as well as with custom training loops. Multi-GPU support is available, along with experimental support for multi worker and Cloud TPUs. Check out the [guide](https://www.tensorflow.org/beta/guide/distribute_strategy) for more details.\r\n* Functions, not Sessions. The traditional declarative programming model of building a graph and executing it via a `tf.Session` is discouraged, and replaced by writing regular Python functions. Using the `tf.function` decorator, such functions can be turned into graphs which can be executed remotely, serialized, and optimized for performance.\r\n* Unification of tf.train.Optimizers and tf.keras.Optimizers. Use tf.keras.Optimizers for TF2.0. `compute_gradients` is removed as public API, and use GradientTape to compute gradients.\r\n* AutoGraph translates Python control flow into TensorFlow expressions, allowing users to write regular Python inside `tf.function`-decorated functions. AutoGraph is also applied in functions used with tf.data, tf.distribute and tf.keras APIs. \r\n* Unification of exchange formats to SavedModel. All TensorFlow ecosystem projects (TensorFlow Lite, TensorFlow JS, TensorFlow Serving, TensorFlow Hub) accept SavedModels. Model state should be saved to and restored from SavedModels.\r\n* API Changes: Many API symbols have been renamed or removed, and argument names have changed. Many of these changes are motivated by consistency and clarity. The 1.x API remains available in the compat.v1 module. A list of all symbol changes can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FLFJLzg7WNP6JHODX5q8BDgptKafq_slHpnHVbJIteQ/edit#gid=0). \r\n * API clean-up, included removing `tf.app`, `tf.flags`, and `tf.logging` in favor of [absl-py](https://github.com/abseil/abseil-py).\r\n* No more global variables with helper methods like `tf.global_variables_initializer` and `tf.get_global_step`.\r\n* Add toggles `tf.enable_control_flow_v2()` and `tf.disable_control_flow_v2()` for enabling/disabling v2 control flow.\r\n* Enable v2 control flow as part of `tf.enable_v2_behavior()` and `TF2_BEHAVIOR=1`.\r\n* Fixes autocomplete for most TensorFlow API references by switching to use relative imports in API `__init__.py` files.\r\n\r\n## Breaking Changes\r\n* Many backwards incompatible API changes have been made to clean up the APIs and make them more consistent.\r\n* Toolchains:\r\n  * TensorFlow 2.0.0 is built using devtoolset7 (GCC7) on Ubuntu 16. This may lead to ABI incompatibilities with extensions built against earlier versions of TensorFlow.\r\n  * Tensorflow code now produces 2 different pip packages: tensorflow_core containing all the code (in the future it will contain only the private implementation) and tensorflow which is a virtual pip package doing forwarding to tensorflow_core (and in the future will contain only the public API of tensorflow). We don't expect this to be breaking, unless you were importing directly from the implementation.\r\n\r\n* `tf.contrib`:\r\n  * `tf.contrib` has been deprecated, and functionality has been either migrated to the core TensorFlow API, to an ecosystem project such as [tensorflow/addons](https://www.github.com/tensorflow/addons) or [tensorflow/io](https://www.github.com/tensorflow/io), or removed entirely.\r\n  * Remove `tf.contrib.timeseries` dependency on TF distributions.\r\n  * Replace contrib references with `tf.estimator.experimental.*` for apis in early_stopping.py.\r\n\r\n* `tf.estimator`:\r\n  * Premade estimators in the tf.estimator.DNN/Linear/DNNLinearCombined family have been updated to use `tf.keras.optimizers` instead of the `tf.compat.v1.train.Optimizer`s. If you do not pass in an `optimizer=` arg or if you use a string, the premade estimator will use the Keras optimizer. This is checkpoint breaking, as the optimizers have separate variables. A checkpoint converter tool for converting optimizers is included with the release,  but if you want to avoid any change, switch to the v1 version of the estimator:  `tf.compat.v1.estimator.DNN/Linear/DNNLinearCombined*`.\r\n  * Default aggregation for canned Estimators is now `SUM_OVER_BATCH_SIZE`. To maintain previous default behavior, please pass `SUM` as the loss aggregation method.\r\n  * Canned Estimators don’t support `input_layer_partitioner` arg in the API. If you have this arg, you will have to switch to `tf.compat.v1 canned Estimators`.\r\n  * `Estimator.export_savedmodel` has been renamed `export_saved_model`.\r\n  * When saving to SavedModel, Estimators will strip default op attributes. This is almost always the correct behavior, as it is more forwards compatible, but if you require that default attributes are saved with the model, please use `tf.compat.v1.Estimator`.\r\n  * Feature Columns have been upgraded to be more Eager-friendly and to work with Keras. As a result, `tf.feature_column.input_layer` has been deprecated in favor of `tf.keras.layers.DenseFeatures`. v1 feature columns have direct analogues in v2 except for `shared_embedding_columns`, which are not cross-compatible with v1 and v2. Use `tf.feature_column.shared_embeddings` instead.\r\n\r\n* `tf.keras`:\r\n  * `OMP_NUM_THREADS` is no longer used by the default Keras config.  To configure the number of threads, use `tf.config.threading` APIs.\r\n  * `tf.keras.model.save_model` and `model.save` now defaults to saving a TensorFlow SavedModel. HDF5 files are still supported.\r\n  * Deprecated `tf.keras.experimental.export_saved_model` and `tf.keras.experimental.function`. Please use `tf.keras.models.save_model(..., save_format='tf')` and `tf.keras.models.load_model` instead.\r\n  * Layers now default to float32, and automatically cast their inputs to the layer's dtype. If you had a model that used float64, it will probably silently use float32 in TensorFlow 2, and a warning will be issued that starts with \"Layer <layer-name> is casting an input tensor from dtype float64 to the layer's dtype of float32\". To fix, either set the default dtype to float64 with `tf.keras.backend.set_floatx('float64')`, or pass `dtype='float64'` to each of the Layer constructors. See `tf.keras.layers.Layer` for more information.\r\n\r\n* `tf.lite`:\r\n  * Removed `lite.OpHint`, `lite.experimental`, and `lite.constant` from 2.0 API.\r\n* Tensors are no longer hashable, but instead compare element-wise with `==` and `!=`. Use `tf.compat.v1.disable_tensor_equality()` to return to the previous behavior.\r\n* Performing equality operations on Tensors or Variables with incompatible shapes an exception is no longer thrown. Instead `__eq__` returns False and `__ne__` returns True.\r\n* Removed `tf.string_split` from v2 API.\r\n* Deprecated the use of `constraint=` and `.constraint` with ResourceVariable.\r\n* Add `UnifiedGRU` as the new GRU implementation for tf2.0. Change the default recurrent activation function for GRU from `hard_sigmoid` to `sigmoid`, and `reset_after` to True in 2.0. Historically recurrent activation is `hard_sigmoid` since it is fast than 'sigmoid'. With new unified backend between CPU and GPU mode, since the CuDNN kernel is using sigmoid, we change the default for CPU mode to sigmoid as well. With that, the default GRU will be compatible with both CPU and GPU kernel. This will enable user with GPU to use CuDNN kernel by default and get a 10x performance boost in training. Note that this is checkpoint breaking change. If user want to use their 1.x pre-trained checkpoint, please construct the layer with GRU(recurrent_activation='hard_sigmoid', reset_after=False) to fallback to 1.x behavior.\r\n* `CUDNN_INSTALL_PATH`, `TENSORRT_INSTALL_PATH`, `NCCL_INSTALL_PATH`, `NCCL_HDR_PATH` are deprecated. Use `TF_CUDA_PATHS` instead which supports a comma-separated list of base paths that are searched to find CUDA libraries and headers.\r\n\r\nRefer to our [public project status tracker](https://github.com/orgs/tensorflow/projects/4) and [issues tagged with `2.0`](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A2.0) on GitHub for insight into recent issues and development progress.\r\n\r\nIf you experience any snags when using TF 2.0, please let us know at the [TF 2.0 Testing User Group](https://groups.google.com/a/tensorflow.org/forum/?utm_medium=email&utm_source=footer#!forum/testing). We have a support mailing list as well as weekly testing meetings, and would love to hear your migration feedback and questions.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Bug Fixes and Other Changes\r\n\r\n* `tf.contrib`:\r\n  * Expose `tf.contrib.proto.*` ops in `tf.io` (they will exist in TF2)\r\n  \r\n* `tf.data`:\r\n  * Add support for TensorArrays to `tf.data Dataset`.\r\n  * Integrate Ragged Tensors with `tf.data`.\r\n  * All core and experimental tf.data transformations that input user-defined functions can span multiple devices now.\r\n  * Extending the TF 2.0 support for `shuffle(..., reshuffle_each_iteration=True)` and `cache()` to work across different Python iterators for the same dataset.\r\n  * Removing the `experimental_numa_aware` option from `tf.data.Options`.\r\n  * Add `num_parallel_reads` and passing in a Dataset containing filenames into `TextLineDataset` and `FixedLengthRecordDataset`.\r\n  * Add support for defaulting the value of `cycle_length` argument of `tf.data.Dataset.interleave` to the number of schedulable CPU cores.\r\n  * Promoting `tf.data.experimental.enumerate_dataset` to core as `tf.data.Dataset.enumerate`.\r\n  * Promoting `tf.data.experimental.unbatch` to core as `tf.data.Dataset.unbatch`.\r\n  * Adds option for introducing slack in the pipeline to reduce CPU contention, via `tf.data.Options().experimental_slack = True`\r\n  * Added experimental support for parallel batching to `batch()` and `padded_batch()`. This functionality can be enabled through tf.data.Options()\r\n  * Support cancellation of long-running `reduce`.\r\n  * Now we use `dataset` node name as prefix instead of the op name, to identify the component correctly in metrics, for pipelines with repeated components.\r\n  * Improve the performance of datasets using `from_tensors()`.\r\n  * Promoting `unbatch` from experimental to core API.\r\n  * Adding support for datasets as inputs to `from_tensors` and `from_tensor_slices` and batching and unbatching of nested datasets.\r\n\r\n* `tf.distribute`:\r\n  * Enable `tf.distribute.experimental.MultiWorkerMirroredStrategy` working in eager mode.\r\n  * Callbacks are supported in `MultiWorkerMirroredStrategy`.\r\n  * Disable `run_eagerly` and distribution strategy if there are symbolic tensors added to the model using `add_metric` or `add_loss`.\r\n  * Loss and gradients should now more reliably be correctly scaled w.r.t. the global batch size when using a `tf.distribute.Strategy`.\r\n  * Set default loss reduction as `AUTO` for improving reliability of loss scaling with distribution strategy and custom training loops. `AUTO` indicates that the reduction option will be determined by the usage context. For almost all cases this defaults to `SUM_OVER_BATCH_SIZE`. When used in distribution strategy scope, outside of built-in training loops such as `tf.keras` `compile` and `fit`, we expect reduction value to be 'None' or 'SUM'. Using other values will raise an error.\r\n  * Support for multi-host `ncclAllReduce` in Distribution Strategy.\r\n\r\n* `tf.estimator`:\r\n  * Replace `tf.contrib.estimator.add_metrics` with `tf.estimator.add_metrics`\r\n  * Use `tf.compat.v1.estimator.inputs` instead of `tf.estimator.inputs`\r\n  * Replace contrib references with `tf.estimator.experimental.*` for apis in early_s in Estimator\r\n  * Canned Estimators will now use keras optimizers by default. An error will be raised if tf.train.Optimizers are used, and you will have to switch to tf.keras.optimizers or tf.compat.v1 canned Estimators.\r\n  * A checkpoint converter for canned Estimators has been provided to transition canned Estimators that are warm started from `tf.train.Optimizers` to `tf.keras.optimizers`.\r\n  * Losses are scaled in canned estimator v2 and not in the optimizers anymore. If you are using Estimator + distribution strategy + optimikzer v1 then the behavior does not change. This implies that if you are using custom estimator with optimizer v2, you have to scale losses. We have new utilities to help scale losses `tf.nn.compute_average_loss`, `tf.nn.scale_regularization_loss`.\r\n\r\n* `tf.keras`:\r\n  * Premade models (including Linear and WideDeep) have been introduced for the purpose of replacing Premade estimators.\r\n  * Model saving changes\r\n  * `model.save` and `tf.saved_model.save` may now save to the TensorFlow SavedModel format. The model can be restored using `tf.keras.models.load_model`. HDF5 files are still supported, and may be used by specifying `save_format=\"h5\"` when saving.\r\n  * Raw TensorFlow functions can now be used in conjunction with the Keras Functional API during model creation. This obviates the need for users to create Lambda layers in most cases when using the Functional API. Like Lambda layers, TensorFlow functions that result in Variable creation or assign ops are not supported.\r\n  * Add support for passing list of lists to the `metrics` argument in Keras `compile`.\r\n  * Add `tf.keras.layers.AbstractRNNCell` as the preferred implementation for RNN cells in TF v2. User can use it to implement RNN cells with custom behavior.\r\n  * Keras training and validation curves are shown on the same plot when using the TensorBoard callback.\r\n  * Switched Keras `fit/evaluate/predict` execution to use only a single unified path by default unless eager execution has been explicitly disabled, regardless of input type. This unified path places an eager-friendly training step inside of a `tf.function`. With this \r\n   1.  All input types are converted to `Dataset`.\r\n   2. The path assumes there is always a distribution strategy. when distribution strategy is not specified the path uses a no-op distribution strategy. \r\n   3. The training step is wrapped in `tf.function` unless `run_eagerly=True` is set in compile. The single path execution code does not yet support all use cases. We fallback to the existing v1 execution paths if your model contains the following: \r\n     1. `sample_weight_mode` in compile \r\n     2. `weighted_metrics` in compile \r\n     3. v1 optimizer \r\n     4. target tensors in compile\r\nIf you are experiencing any issues because of this change, please inform us (file an issue) about your use case and you can unblock yourself by setting `experimental_run_tf_function=False` in compile meanwhile. We have seen couple of use cases where the model usage pattern is not as expected and would not work with this change.\r\n   1. output tensors of one layer is used in the constructor of another.\r\n   2. symbolic tensors outside the scope of the model are used in custom loss functions.\r\n   The flag can be disabled for these cases and ideally the usage pattern will need to be fixed.\r\n  * Mark Keras `set_session` as `compat.v1` only.\r\n  * `tf.keras.estimator.model_to_estimator` now supports exporting to `tf.train.Checkpoint format`, which allows the saved checkpoints to be compatible with `model.load_weights`.\r\n  * `keras.backend.resize_images` (and consequently, `keras.layers.Upsampling2D`) behavior has changed, a bug in the resizing implementation was fixed.\r\n  * Add an `implementation=3` mode for `tf.keras.layers.LocallyConnected2D` and `tf.keras.layers.LocallyConnected1D` layers using `tf.SparseTensor` to store weights,  allowing a dramatic speedup for large sparse models.\r\n  * Raise error if `batch_size` argument is used when input is dataset/generator/keras sequence.\r\n  * Update TF 2.0 `keras.backend.name_scope` to use TF 2.0 `name_scope`.\r\n  * Add v2 module aliases for losses, metrics, initializers and optimizers: `tf.losses = tf.keras.losses` & `tf.metrics = tf.keras.metrics` &  `tf.initializers = tf.keras.initializers` & `tf.optimizers = tf.keras.optimizers`.\r\n  * Updates binary cross entropy logic in Keras when input is probabilities. Instead of converting probabilities to logits, we are using the cross entropy formula for probabilities.\r\n  * Added public APIs for `cumsum` and `cumprod` keras backend functions.\r\n  * Add support for temporal sample weight mode in subclassed models.\r\n  * Raise ValueError if an integer is passed to the training APIs. \r\n  * Added fault-tolerance support for training Keras model via `model.fit()` with `MultiWorkerMirroredStrategy`, tutorial available.\r\n  * Custom Callback tutorial is now available.\r\n  * To train with `tf.distribute`, Keras api is recommended over estimator.\r\n  * `steps_per_epoch` and `steps` arguments are supported with numpy arrays.\r\n  * New error message when unexpected keys are used in sample_weight/class_weight dictionaries \r\n  * Losses are scaled in Keras compile/fit and not in the optimizers anymore. If you are using custom training loop, we have new utilities to help scale losses `tf.nn.compute_average_loss`, `tf.nn.scale_regularization_loss`.\r\n  * `Layer` apply and add_variable APIs are deprecated.\r\n  * Added support for channels first data format in cross entropy losses with logits and support for tensors with unknown ranks.\r\n  * Error messages will be raised if `add_update`, `add_metric`, `add_loss`, activity regularizers are used inside of a control flow branch.\r\n  * New loss reduction types: \r\n    1. `AUTO`: Indicates that the reduction option will be determined by the usage context. For almost all cases this defaults to `SUM_OVER_BATCH_SIZE`. When    used with `tf.distribute.Strategy`, outside of built-in training loops such as `tf.keras` `compile` and `fit`, we expect reduction value to be `SUM` or `NONE`. Using `AUTO` in that case will raise an error. \r\n    2. `NONE`: Weighted losses with one dimension reduced (axis=-1, or axis specified by loss function). When this reduction type used with built-in Keras training loops like `fit`/`evaluate`, the unreduced vector loss is passed to the optimizer but the reported loss will be a scalar value. \r\n    3. `SUM`: Scalar sum of weighted losses. 4. `SUM_OVER_BATCH_SIZE`: Scalar `SUM` divided by number of elements in losses. This reduction type is not supported when used with `tf.distribute.Strategy` outside of built-in training loops like `tf.keras` `compile`/`fit`.\r\n  * Wraps losses passed to the `compile` API (strings and v1 losses) which are not instances of v2 `Loss` class in `LossWrapper` class. => All losses will now use `SUM_OVER_BATCH_SIZE` reduction as default.\r\n  * `model.add_loss(symbolic_tensor)` should work in ambient eager.\r\n  * Update metric name to always reflect what the user has given in compile. Affects following cases \r\n    1. When name is given as 'accuracy'/'crossentropy' \r\n    2. When an aliased function name is used eg. 'mse' \r\n    3. Removing the `weighted` prefix from weighted metric names.\r\n  * Allow non-Tensors through v2 losses.\r\n  * Add v2 sparse categorical crossentropy metric.\r\n  * Add v2 APIs for `AUCCurve` and `AUCSummationMethod` enums.\r\n  * `add_update` can now be passed a zero-arg callable in order to support turning off the update when setting `trainable=False` on a Layer of a Model compiled with `run_eagerly=True`.\r\n  * Standardize the LayerNormalization API by replacing the args `norm_axis` and `params_axis` with `axis`.\r\n  * Fixed critical bugs that help with DenseFeatures usability in TF2\r\n\r\n* `tf.lite`:\r\n  * Added evaluation script for `COCO` minival\r\n  * Add delegate support for `QUANTIZE`.\r\n  * Add `GATHER` support to NN API delegate.\r\n  * Added support for TFLiteConverter Python API in 2.0. Contains functions from_saved_model, from_keras_file, and from_concrete_functions.\r\n  * Add `EXPAND_DIMS` support to NN API delegate TEST.\r\n  * Add `narrow_range` attribute to QuantizeAndDequantizeV2 and V3.\r\n  * Added support for `tflite_convert` command line tool in 2.0.\r\n  * Post-training quantization tool supports quantizing weights shared by multiple operations. The models made with versions of this tool will use INT8 types for weights and will only be executable interpreters from this version onwards.\r\n  * Post-training quantization tool supports fp16 weights and GPU delegate acceleration for fp16.\r\n  * Add delegate support for `QUANTIZED_16BIT_LSTM`.\r\n  * Extracts `NNAPIDelegateKernel` from nnapi_delegate.cc\r\n  \r\n* Other:\r\n  * Fix accidental quadratic graph construction cost in graph-mode `tf.gradients()`.\r\n  * ResourceVariable's gather op supports batch dimensions.\r\n  * ResourceVariable support for `gather_nd`.\r\n  * `ResourceVariable` and `Variable` no longer accepts `constraint` in the constructor, nor expose it as a @property.\r\n  * Added gradient for `SparseToDense` op.\r\n  * Expose a flag that allows the number of threads to vary across Python benchmarks.\r\n  * `image.resize` in 2.0 now supports gradients for the new resize kernels.\r\n  * `image.resize` now considers proper pixel centers and has new kernels (incl. anti-aliasing).\r\n  * Renamed `tf.image` functions to remove duplicate \"image\" where it is redundant.\r\n  * Variadic reduce is supported on CPU Variadic reduce is supported on CPU\r\n  * Remove unused `StringViewVariantWrapper`.\r\n  * Delete unused `Fingerprint64Map` op registration\r\n  * Add broadcasting support to `tf.matmul`.\r\n  * Add C++ Gradient for

    "body": "# Release 1.15.0-rc0\r\nThis is the last 1.x release for TensorFlow. We do not expect to update the 1.x branch with features, although we will issue patch releases to fix vulnerabilities for at least one year. \r\n\r\n## Major Features and Improvements\r\n* As [announced](https://groups.google.com/a/tensorflow.org/forum/#!topic/developers/iRCt5m4qUz0), `tensorflow` pip package will by default include GPU support (same as `tensorflow-gpu` now) for the platforms we currently have GPU support (Linux and Windows). It will work on machines with and without Nvidia GPUs. `tensorflow-gpu` will still be available, and CPU-only packages can be downloaded at `tensorflow-cpu` for users who are concerned about package size.\r\n* TensorFlow 1.15 contains a complete implementation of the 2.0 API in its `compat.v2 module`. It contains a copy of the 1.15 main module (without `contrib`) in the `compat.v1 module`. TensorFlow 1.15 is able to emulate 2.0 behavior using the `enable_v2_behavior()` function.\r\nThis enables writing forward compatible code: by explicitly importing either `tensorflow.compat.v1` or `tensorflow.compat.v2`, you can ensure that your code works without modifications against an installation of 1.15 or 2.0.\r\n* EagerTensor now supports numpy buffer interface for tensors.\r\n* Add toggles `tf.enable_control_flow_v2()` and `tf.disable_control_flow_v2()` for enabling/disabling v2 control flow.\r\n* Enable v2 control flow as part of `tf.enable_v2_behavior()` and `TF2_BEHAVIOR=1`.\r\n* AutoGraph translates Python control flow into TensorFlow expressions, allowing users to write regular Python inside `tf.function`-decorated functions. AutoGraph is also applied in functions used with `tf.data`, `tf.distribute` and `tf.keras` APIS.\r\n* Adds `enable_tensor_equality()`, which switches the behavior such that: \r\n  * Tensors are no longer hashable.\r\n  * Tensors can be compared with == and !=, yielding a Boolean Tensor with element-wise comparison results. This will be the default behavior in 2.0.\r\n\r\n## Breaking Changes\r\n* Tensorflow code now produces 2 different pip packages: tensorflow_core containing all the code (in the future it will contain only the private implementation) and tensorflow which is a virtual pip package doing forwarding to tensorflow_core (and in the future will contain only the public API of tensorflow). We don't expect this to be breaking, unless you were importing directly from the implementation.\r\n* TensorFlow 1.15 is built using devtoolset7 (GCC7) on Ubuntu 16. This may lead to ABI incompatibilities with extensions built against earlier versions of TensorFlow.\r\n* Deprecated the use of `constraint=` and `.constraint` with ResourceVariable.\r\n* `tf.keras`:\r\n  * `OMP_NUM_THREADS` is no longer used by the default Keras config. To configure the number of threads, use `tf.config.threading` APIs.\r\n  * `tf.keras.model.save_model` and `model.save` now defaults to saving a TensorFlow SavedModel.\r\n  * `keras.backend.resize_images` (and consequently, `keras.layers.Upsampling2D`) behavior has changed, a bug in the resizing implementation was fixed.\r\n  * Layers now default to `float32`, and automatically cast their inputs to the layer's dtype. If you had a model that used `float64`, it will probably silently use `float32` in TensorFlow2, and a warning will be issued that starts with Layer \"layer-name\" is casting an input tensor from dtype float64 to the layer's dtype of float32. To fix, either set the default dtype to float64 with `tf.keras.backend.set_floatx('float64')`, or pass `dtype='float64'` to each of the Layer constructors. See `tf.keras.layers.Layer` for more information.\r\n  * Some `tf.assert_*` methods now raise assertions at operation creation time (i.e. when this Python line executes) if the input tensors' values are known at that time, not during the session.run(). When this happens, a noop is returned and the input tensors are marked non-feedable. In other words, if they are used as keys in `feed_dict` argument to `session.run()`, an error will be raised. Also, because some assert ops don't make it into the graph, the graph structure changes. A different graph can result in different per-op random seeds when they are not given explicitly (most often).\r\n\r\n## Bug Fixes and Other Changes\r\n* `tf.data`:\r\n  * Promoting `unbatch` from experimental to core API.\r\n  * Adding support for datasets as inputs to `from_tensors` and `from_tensor_slices` and batching and unbatching of nested datasets.\r\n* `tf.keras`:\r\n  * `tf.keras.estimator.model_to_estimator` now supports exporting to tf.train.Checkpoint format, which allows the saved checkpoints to be compatible with `model.load_weights`.\r\n  * Saving a Keras Model using `tf.saved_model.save` now saves the list of variables, trainable variables, regularization losses, and the call function.\r\n  * Deprecated `tf.keras.experimental.export_saved_model` and `tf.keras.experimental.function`. Please use `tf.keras.models.save_model(..., save_format='tf')` and `tf.keras.models.load_model` instead.\r\n  * Add an `implementation=3` mode for `tf.keras.layers.LocallyConnected2D` and `tf.keras.layers.LocallyConnected1D` layers using `tf.SparseTensor` to store weights,  allowing a dramatic speedup for large sparse models.\r\n  * Enable the Keras compile API `experimental_run_tf_function` flag by default. This flag enables single training/eval/predict execution path. With this 1. All input types are converted to `Dataset`. 2. When distribution strategy is not specified this goes through the no-op distribution strategy path. 3. Execution is wrapped in tf.function unless `run_eagerly=True` is set in compile.\r\n  * Raise error if `batch_size` argument is used when input is dataset/generator/keras sequence.\r\n* `tf.lite`\r\n  * Add `GATHER` support to NN API delegate.\r\n  * tflite object detection script has a debug mode.\r\n  * Add delegate support for `QUANTIZE`.\r\n  * Added evaluation script for COCO minival.\r\n  * Add delegate support for `QUANTIZED_16BIT_LSTM`.\r\n  * Converts hardswish subgraphs into atomic ops.\r\n* Add support for defaulting the value of `cycle_length` argument of `tf.data.Dataset.interleave` to the number of schedulable CPU cores.\r\n* `parallel_for`: Add converter for `MatrixDiag`.\r\n* Add `narrow_range` attribute to `QuantizeAndDequantizeV2` and V3.\r\n* Added new op: `tf.strings.unsorted_segment_join`.\r\n* Add HW acceleration support for `topK_v2`.\r\n* Add new `TypeSpec` classes.\r\n* CloudBigtable version updated to v0.10.0.\r\n* Expose `Head` as public API.\r\n* Update docstring for gather to properly describe the non-empty `batch_dims` case.\r\n* Added `tf.sparse.from_dense` utility function.\r\n* Improved ragged tensor support in `TensorFlowTestCase`.\r\n* Makes the a-normal form transformation in Pyct configurable as to which nodes are converted to variables and which are not.\r\n* `ResizeInputTensor` now works for all delegates.\r\n* Add `EXPAND_DIMS` support to NN API delegate TEST:  expand_dims_test\r\n* `tf.cond` emits a StatelessIf op if the branch functions are stateless and do not touch any resources.\r\n* `tf.cond`, `tf.while` and `if` and `while` in AutoGraph now accept a nonscalar predicate if has a single element. This does not affect non-V2 control flow.\r\n* `tf.while_loop` emits a StatelessWhile op if the cond and body functions are stateless and do not touch any resources.\r\n* Refactors code in Quant8 LSTM support to reduce TFLite binary size.\r\n* Add support of local soft device placement for eager op.\r\n* Add HW acceleration support for `LogSoftMax`.\r\n* Added a function `nested_value_rowids` for ragged tensors.\r\n* Add guard to avoid acceleration of L2 Normalization with input rank != 4\r\n* Add `tf.math.cumulative_logsumexp operation`.\r\n* Add `tf.ragged.stack`.\r\n* Fix memory allocation problem when calling `AddNewInputConstantTensor`.\r\n* Delegate application failure leaves interpreter in valid state.\r\n* Add check for correct memory alignment to `MemoryAllocation::MemoryAllocation()`.\r\n* Extracts `NNAPIDelegateKernel` from nnapi_delegate.cc\r\n* Added support for `FusedBatchNormV3` in converter.\r\n* A ragged to dense op for directly calculating tensors.\r\n* Fix accidental quadratic graph construction cost in graph-mode `tf.gradients()`.\r\n\r\n## Thanks to our Contributors\r\n\r\nThis release contains contributions from many people at Google, as well as:\r\n\r\na6802739, Aaron Ma, Abdullah Selek, Abolfazl Shahbazi, Ag Ramesh, Albert Z.

    "body": "# Release 2.0.0-rc0\r\n\r\n## Major Features and Improvements\r\n\r\nTensorFlow 2.0 focuses on **simplicity** and **ease of use**, featuring updates like:\r\n\r\n* Easy model building with Keras and eager execution.\r\n* Robust model deployment in production on any platform.\r\n* Powerful experimentation for research.\r\n* API simplification by reducing duplication and removing deprecated endpoints.\r\n\r\nFor details on best practices with 2.0, see [the Effective 2.0 guide](https://www.tensorflow.org/beta/guide/effective_tf2)\r\n\r\n\r\nFor information on upgrading your existing TensorFlow 1.x models, please refer to our [Upgrade](https://medium.com/tensorflow/upgrading-your-code-to-tensorflow-2-0-f72c3a4d83b5) and [Migration](https://www.tensorflow.org/beta/guide/migration_guide) guides. We have also released a collection of [tutorials and getting started guides](https://www.tensorflow.org/beta).\r\n\r\n## Highlights\r\n\r\n* TF 2.0 delivers Keras as the central high level API used to build and train models. Keras provides several model-building APIs such as Sequential, Functional, and Subclassing along with eager execution, for immediate iteration and intuitive debugging, and tf.data, for building scalable input pipelines. Checkout [guide](https://www.tensorflow.org/beta/guide/keras/overview) for additional details.\r\n* Distribution Strategy: TF 2.0 users will be able to use the [`tf.distribute.Strategy`](https://www.tensorflow.org/beta/guide/distribute_strategy) API to distribute training with minimal code changes, yielding great out-of-the-box performance. It supports distributed training with Keras model.fit, as well as with custom training loops. Multi-GPU support is available, along with experimental support for multi worker and Cloud TPUs. Check out the [guide](https://www.tensorflow.org/beta/guide/distribute_strategy) for more details.\r\n* Functions, not Sessions. The traditional declarative programming model of building a graph and executing it via a `tf.Session` is discouraged, and replaced with by writing regular Python functions. Using the `tf.function` decorator, such functions can be turned into graphs which can be executed remotely, serialized, and optimized for performance.\r\n* Unification of tf.train.Optimizers and tf.keras.Optimizers. Use tf.keras.Optimizers for TF2.0. `compute_gradients` is removed as public API, and use GradientTape to compute gradients.\r\n* AutoGraph translates Python control flow into TensorFlow expressions, allowing users to write regular Python inside `tf.function`-decorated functions. AutoGraph is also applied in functions used with tf.data, tf.distribute and tf.keras APIs. \r\n* Unification of exchange formats to SavedModel. All TensorFlow ecosystem projects (TensorFlow Lite, TensorFlow JS, TensorFlow Serving, TensorFlow Hub) accept SavedModels. Model state should be saved to and restored from SavedModels.\r\n* API Changes: Many API symbols have been renamed or removed, and argument names have changed. Many of these changes are motivated by consistency and clarity. The 1.x API remains available in the compat.v1 module. A list of all symbol changes can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FLFJLzg7WNP6JHODX5q8BDgptKafq_slHpnHVbJIteQ/edit#gid=0). \r\n * API clean-up, included removing `tf.app`, `tf.flags`, and `tf.logging` in favor of [absl-py](https://github.com/abseil/abseil-py).\r\n* No more global variables with helper methods like `tf.global_variables_initializer` and `tf.get_global_step`.\r\n\r\n## Breaking Changes\r\n* Many backwards incompatible API changes have been made to clean up the APIs and make them more consistent.\r\n* `tf.contrib` has been deprecated, and functionality has been either migrated to the core TensorFlow API, to an ecosystem project such as [tensorflow/addons](https://www.github.com/tensorflow/addons) or [tensorflow/io](https://www.github.com/tensorflow/io), or removed entirely.\r\n* Premade estimators in the tf.estimator.DNN/Linear/DNNLinearCombined family have been updated to use `tf.keras.optimizers` instead of the `tf.compat.v1.train.Optimizer`s. If you do not pass in an `optimizer=` arg or if you use a string, the premade estimator will use the Keras optimizer. This is checkpoint breaking, as the optimizers have separate variables. A checkpoint converter tool for converting optimizers is included with the release,  but if you want to avoid any change, switch to the v1 version of the estimator:  `tf.compat.v1.estimator.DNN/Linear/DNNLinearCombined*`.\r\n* The equality operation on Tensors & Variables now compares on value instead of `id()`. As a result, both Tensors & Variables are no longer hashable types.\r\n* Layers now default to float32, and automatically cast their inputs to the layer's dtype. If you had a model that used float64, it will probably silently use float32 in TensorFlow 2, and a warning will be issued that starts with \"Layer <layer-name> is casting an input tensor from dtype float64 to the layer's dtype of float32\". To fix, either set the default dtype to float64 with `tf.keras.backend.set_floatx('float64')`, or pass `dtype='float64'` to each of the Layer constructors. See `tf.keras.layers.Layer` for more information.\r\n\r\nRefer to our [public project status tracker](https://github.com/orgs/tensorflow/projects/4) and [issues tagged with `2.0`](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A2.0) on GitHub for insight into recent issues and development progress.\r\n\r\nIf you experience any snags when using TF 2.0, please let us know at the [TF 2.0 Testing User Group](https://groups.google.com/a/tensorflow.org/forum/?utm_medium=email&utm_source=footer#!forum/testing). We have a support mailing list as well as weekly testing meetings, and would love to hear your migration feedback and questions.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Bug Fixes and Other Changes\r\n\r\n* `tf.data`:\r\n  * Add support for TensorArrays to `tf.data Dataset`.\r\n  * Integrate Ragged Tensors with `tf.data`.\r\n  * All core and experimental tf.data transformations that input user-defined functions can span multiple devices now.\r\n  * Extending the TF 2.0 support for `shuffle(..., reshuffle_each_iteration=True)` and `cache()` to work across different Python iterators for the same dataset.\r\n  * Removing the `experimental_numa_aware` option from `tf.data.Options`.\r\n  * Add `num_parallel_reads` and passing in a Dataset containing filenames into `TextLineDataset` and `FixedLengthRecordDataset`.\r\n  * Add support for defaulting the value of `cycle_length` argument of `tf.data.Dataset.interleave` to the number of schedulable CPU cores.\r\n  * Promoting `tf.data.experimental.enumerate_dataset` to core as `tf.data.Dataset.enumerate`.\r\n  * Promoting `tf.data.experimental.unbatch` to core as `tf.data.Dataset.unbatch`.\r\n  * Adds option for introducing slack in the pipeline to reduce CPU contention, via `tf.data.Options().experimental_slack = True`\r\n  * Added experimental support for parallel batching to `batch()` and `padded_batch()`. This functionality can be enabled through tf.data.Options()\r\n  * Support cancellation of long-running `reduce`.\r\n  * Now we use `dataset` node name as prefix instead of the op name, to identify the component correctly in metrics, for pipelines with repeated components.\r\n\r\n* `tf.distribute`:\r\n  * Enable `tf.distribute.experimental.MultiWorkerMirroredStrategy` working in eager mode.\r\n  * Disable `run_eagerly` and distribution strategy if there are symbolic tensors added to the model using `add_metric` or `add_loss`.\r\n  * Bug fix: loss and gradients should now more reliably be correctly scaled w.r.t. the global batch size when using a `tf.distribute.Strategy`.\r\n  * Set default loss reduction as `AUTO` for improving reliability of loss scaling with distribution strategy and custom training loops. `AUTO` indicates that the reduction option will be determined by the usage context. For almost all cases this defaults to `SUM_OVER_BATCH_SIZE`. When used in distribution strategy scope, outside of built-in training loops such as `tf.keras` `compile` and `fit`, we expect reduction value to be 'None' or 'SUM'. Using other values will raise an error.\r\n  * Support for multi-host `ncclAllReduce` in Distribution Strategy.\r\n\r\n* `tf.estimator`:\r\n  * Replace `tf.contrib.estimator.add_metrics` with `tf.estimator.add_metrics`\r\n  * Use `tf.compat.v1.estimator.inputs` instead of `tf.estimator.inputs`\r\n  * Replace contrib references with tf.estimator.experimental.* for apis in early_s in Estimator\r\n  * Canned Estimators will now use keras optimizers by default. An error will be raised if tf.train.Optimizers are used, and you will have to switch to tf.keras.optimizers or tf.compat.v1 canned Estimators.\r\n  * A checkpoint converter for canned Estimators has been provided to transition canned Estimators that are warm started from tf.train.Optimizers to tf.keras.optimizers.\r\n  * Default aggregation for canned Estimators is now SUM_OVER_BATCH_SIZE. To maintain previous default behavior, please pass SUM as the loss aggregation method.\r\n  * Canned Estimators don’t support `input_layer_partitioner` arg in the API. If you have this arg, you will have to switch to tf.compat.v1 canned Estimators.\r\n  * Estimator.export_savedmodel has been renamed export_saved_model\r\n  * When saving to SavedModel, Estimators will strip default op attributes. This is almost always the correct behavior, as it is more forwards compatible, but if you require that default attributes are saved with the model, please use tf.compat.v1.Estimator\r\n  * Feature Columns have been upgraded to be more Eager-friendly and to work with Keras. As a result, tf.feature_column.input_layer has been deprecated in favor of tf.keras.layers.DenseFeatures. v1 feature columns have direct analogues in v2 except for shared_embedding_columns, which are not cross-compatible with v1 and v2. Use tf.feature_column.shared_embeddings instead.\r\n  * Losses are scaled in canned estimator v2 and not in the optimizers anymore. If you are using Estimator + distribution strategy + optimikzer v1 then the behavior does not change. This implies that if you are using custom estimator with optimizer v2, you have to scale losses. We have new utilities to help scale losses `tf.nn.compute_average_loss`, `tf.nn.scale_regularization_loss`.\r\n\r\n* `tf.keras`:\r\n  * Premade models (including Linear and WideDeep) have been introduced for the purpose of replacing Premade estimators.\r\n  * Model saving changes\r\n  * `model.save` and `tf.saved_model.save` may now save to the TensorFlow SavedModel format. The model can be restored using `tf.keras.models.load_model`. HDF5 files are still supported, and may be used by specifying `save_format=\"h5\"` when saving.\r\n  * `tf.keras.model.save_model` and `model.save` now defaults to saving a TensorFlow SavedModel. HDF5 files are still supported.\r\n  * Deprecated `tf.keras.experimental.export_saved_model` and `tf.keras.experimental.function`. Please use `tf.keras.models.save_model(..., save_format='tf')` and tf.keras.models.load_model` instead.\r\n  * Raw TensorFlow functions can now be used in conjunction with the Keras Functional API during model creation. This obviates the need for users to create Lambda layers in most cases when using the Functional API. Like Lambda layers, TensorFlow functions that result in Variable creation or assign ops are not supported.\r\n  * Add support for passing list of lists to the `metrics` argument in Keras `compile. \r\n  * Add `tf.keras.layers.AbstractRNNCell` as the preferred implementation for RNN cells in TF v2. User can use it to implement RNN cells with custom behavior.\r\n  * Keras training and validation curves are shown on the same plot when using the TensorBoard callback.\r\n  * Switched Keras `fit/evaluate/predict` execution to use only a single unified path by default unless eager execution has been explicitly disabled, regardless of input type. This unified path places an eager-friendly training step inside of a `tf.function`. With this 1. All input types are converted to `Dataset`. 2. The path assumes there is always a distribution strategy. when distribution strategy is not specified the path uses a no-op distribution strategy. 3. The training step is wrapped in tf.function unless `run_eagerly=True` is set in compile. The single path execution code does not yet support all use cases. We fallback to the existing v1 execution paths if your model contains the following: 1. sample_weight_mode in compile 2. weighted_metrics in compile 3. v1 optimizer 4. target tensors in compile. If you are experiencing any issues because of this change, please inform us (file an issue) about your use case and you can unblock yourself by setting `experimental_run_tf_function=False` in compile meanwhile. We have seen couple of use cases where the model usage pattern is not as expected and would not work with this change. 1. output tensors of one layer is used in the constructor of another. 2. symbolic tensors outside the scope of the model are used in custom loss functions. The flag can be disabled for these cases and ideally the usage pattern will need to be fixed.\r\n  * `OMP_NUM_THREADS` is no longer used by the default Keras config.  To configure the number of threads, use `tf.config.threading` APIs.\r\n  * Mark Keras `set_session` as `compat.v1` only.\r\n  * `tf.keras.estimator.model_to_estimator` now supports exporting to `tf.train.Checkpoint format`, which allows the saved checkpoints to be compatible with `model.load_weights`.\r\n  * `keras.backend.resize_images` (and consequently, `keras.layers.Upsampling2D`) behavior has changed, a bug in the resizing implementation was fixed.\r\n  * Add an `implementation=3` mode for `tf.keras.layers.LocallyConnected2D` and `tf.keras.layers.LocallyConnected1D` layers using `tf.SparseTensor` to store weights,  allowing a dramatic speedup for large sparse models.\r\n  * Raise error if `batch_size` argument is used when input is dataset/generator/keras sequence.\r\n  * Update TF 2.0 `keras.backend.name_scope` to use TF 2.0 `name_scope`.\r\n  * Add v2 module aliases for losses, metrics, initializers and optimizers: `tf.losses = tf.keras.losses` & `tf.metrics = tf.keras.metrics` &  `tf.initializers = tf.keras.initializers` & `tf.optimizers = tf.keras.optimizers`.\r\n  * Updates binary cross entropy logic in Keras when input is probabilities. Instead of converting probabilities to logits, we are using the cross entropy formula for probabilities.\r\n  * Added public APIs for `cumsum` and `cumprod` keras backend functions.\r\n  * Add support for temporal sample weight mode in subclassed models.\r\n  * Raise ValueError if an integer is passed to the training APIs. \r\n  * Added fault-tolerance support for training Keras model via `model.fit()` with `MultiWorkerMirroredStrategy`, tutorial available.\r\n  * Callbacks are supported in `MultiWorkerMirroredStrategy`.\r\n  * Custom Callback tutorial is now available.\r\n  * To train with `tf.distribute`, Keras api is recommended over estimator.\r\n  * `steps_per_epoch` and `steps` arguments are supported with numpy arrays.\r\n  * New error message when unexpected keys are used in sample_weight/class_weight dictionaries \r\n  * Losses are scaled in Keras compile/fit and not in the optimizers anymore. If you are using custom training loop, we have new utilities to help scale losses `tf.nn.compute_average_loss`, `tf.nn.scale_regularization_loss`.\r\n  * `Layer` apply and add_variable APIs are deprecated.\r\n  * Added support for channels first data format in cross entropy losses with logits and support for tensors with unknown ranks.\r\n  * Error messages will be raised if `add_update`, `add_metric`, `add_loss`, activity regularizers are used inside of a control flow branch.\r\n  * New loss reduction types: 1. `AUTO`: Indicates that the reduction option will be determined by the usage context. For almost all cases this defaults to `SUM_OVER_BATCH_SIZE`. When    used with `tf.distribute.Strategy`, outside of built-in training loops such as `tf.keras` `compile` and `fit`, we expect reduction value to be `SUM` or `NONE`. Using `AUTO` in that case will raise an error. 2. `NONE`: Weighted losses with one dimension reduced (axis=-1, or axis specified by loss function). When this reduction type used with built-in Keras training loops like `fit`/`evaluate`, the unreduced vector loss is passed to the optimizer but the reported loss will be a scalar value. 3. `SUM`: Scalar sum of weighted losses. 4. `SUM_OVER_BATCH_SIZE`: Scalar `SUM` divided by number of elements in losses. This reduction type is not supported when used with `tf.distribute.Strategy` outside of built-in training loops like `tf.keras` `compile`/`fit`.\r\n\r\n* `tf.lite`:\r\n  * Added support for TFLiteConverter Python API in 2.0.

Change the default recurrent activation function for GRU from 'hard_sigmoid' to 'sigmoid', and 'reset_after' to True in 2.0. Historically recurrent activation is 'hard_sigmoid' since it is fast than 'sigmoid'. With new unified backend between CPU and GPU mode, since the CuDNN kernel is using sigmoid, we change the default for CPU mode to sigmoid as well. With that, the default GRU will be compatible with both CPU and GPU kernel. This will enable user with GPU to use CuDNN kernel by default and get a 10x performance boost in training. Note that this is checkpoint breaking change. If user want to use their 1.x pre-trained checkpoint, please construct the layer with GRU(recurrent_activation='hard_sigmoid', reset_after=False) to fallback to 1.x behavior.\r\n  * Begin adding Go wrapper for C Eager API\r\n  * XLA HLO graphs can be inspected with interactive_graphviz tool now.\r\n  * Add dataset ops to the graph (or create kernels in Eager execution) during the python Dataset object creation instead doing it during Iterator creation time.\r\n  * Add batch_dims argument to tf.gather.\r\n  * Removing of dtype in the constructor of initializers and partition_info in call.\r\n  * Add `tf.math.nextafter` op.\r\n  * Turn on MKL-DNN contraction kernels by default. MKL-DNN dynamically dispatches the best kernel implementation based on CPU vector architecture. To disable them, build with --define=tensorflow_mkldnn_contraction_kernel=0.\r\n  * `tf.linspace(start, stop, num)` now always uses \"stop\" as last value (for num > 1)\r\n  * Added top-k to precision and recall to keras metrics.\r\n  * Add a ragged size op and register it to the op dispatcher\r\n  * Transitive dependencies on :pooling_ops were removed.  Some users may need to add explicit dependencies on :pooling_ops if they reference the operators from that library.\r\n  * Add CompositeTensor base class.\r\n  * Malformed gif images could result in an access out of bounds in the color palette of the frame. This has been fixed now\r\n  * Add templates and interfaces for creating lookup tables\r\n  * Tensor::UnsafeCopyFromInternal deprecated in favor Tensor::BitcastFrom\r\n  * In `map_vectorization` optimization, reduce the degree of parallelism in the vectorized map node.\r\n  * Add variant wrapper for absl::string_view\r\n  * Wraps losses passed to the `compile` API (strings and v1 losses) which are not instances of v2 `Loss` class in `LossWrapper` class. => All losses will now use `SUM_OVER_BATCH_SIZE` reduction as default.\r\n  * Add OpKernels for some stateless maps\r\n  * Add v2 APIs for AUCCurve and AUCSummationMethod enums. #tf-metrics-convergence\r\n  * Allow non-Tensors through v2 losses.\r\n  * Add v2 sparse categorical crossentropy metric.

GITHUB_PR_OR_BUG=b/123431691\r\n  * Add support for `add_metric` in the graph function mode. GITHUB_PR_OR_BUG=tf_only\r\n  * Updating cosine similarity loss - removed the negate sign from cosine similarity. GITHUB_PR_OR_BUG=b/123431691\r\n  * TF 2.0 - Update metric name to always reflect what the user has given in compile. Affects following cases 1. When name is given as 'accuracy'/'crossentropy' 2. When an aliased function name is used eg. 'mse' 3. Removing the `weighted` prefix from weighted metric names.\r\n  * Workaround for compiler bug(?)\r\n  * Changed default for gradient accumulation for TPU embeddings to true.\r\n  * Adds summary trace API for collecting graph and profile information.\r\n  * `image.resize` now considers proper pixel centers and has new kernels (incl. anti-aliasing).\r\n \r\n\r\n## Thanks to our Contributors\r\n\r\nThis release contains contributions from many people at Google, as well as:\r\n\r\n1e100, a6802739, Abolfazl Shahbazi, Adam Weiss, Ag Ramesh, Alan Du, Albin Joy, Amit, Amit Srivastava, Andy Craze, Anshuman Tripathy, Armen Poghosov, armenpoghosov, Arpit Shah, Ashwin Ramaswami, Aurelien Geron, AuréLien Geron, aweers, awesomealex1, Bairen Yi, Ben Barsdell, Bhavani Subramanian, Brandon Carter, candy.dc, Chao Liu, Clayne Robison, csukuangfj, Dan Jarvis, Dan Lazewatsky, Daniel Ingram, Dave Airlie, David Norman, Dayananda V, Denis Khalikov, Deven Desai, Dheeraj Rajaram Reddy, dmitrievanthony, Drew Szurko, Duncan Riach, Fei Hu, Felix Lemke, Filip Matzner, fo40225, frreiss, Gautam, gehring, Grzegorz George Pawelczak, Grzegorz Pawelczak, HanGuo97, Hari Shankar, hehongliang, Heungsub Lee, Hoeseong Kim, I-Hong Jhuo, Ilango R, Innovimax, Jacky Ko, Jakub Lipinski,  jcf94, Jeff Poznanovic, Jia Qingtong, Jiankang, Joe Q, Joe Quadrino, Jonas Rauber, Jonathan Kyl, Joppe Geluykens, Joseph Friedman, jtressle, jwu, K.

    "body": "# Release 1.14.0\r\n\r\n## Major Features and Improvements\r\n\r\n* This is the first 1.x release containing the compat.v2 module. This module is required to allow libraries to publish code which works in both 1.x and 2.x. After this release, no backwards incompatible changes are allowed in the 2.0 Python API.\r\n* Turn on MKL-DNN contraction kernels by default. MKL-DNN dynamically dispatches the best kernel implementation based on CPU vector architecture. To disable them, build with --define=tensorflow_mkldnn_contraction_kernel=0.\r\n* Non-Windows system libraries are now versioned. This should be a no-op for most users as it affects only system package maintainers or those building extensions to TensorFlow:\r\n  * Python wheels (Pip packages) contain one library file.\r\n    * Linux: `libtensorflow_framework.so.1`\r\n    * MacOS: `libtensorflow_framework.1.dylib`\r\n  * Our `libtensorflow` tarball archives contain the `libtensorflow` library and two symlinks. MacOS `.dylib` libraries are the same, but match MacOS library naming requirements (i.e. `libtensorflow.1.dylib`):\r\n    * `libtensorflow.so.1.14.0`, the main library\r\n    * `libtensorflow.so.1`, symlinked to the main library\r\n    * `libtensorflow.so`, symlinked to `.so.1`\r\n\r\n## Behavioral changes\r\n\r\n* Set default loss reduction as `AUTO` for improving reliability of loss scaling with distribution strategy and custom training loops. `AUTO` indicates that the reduction option will be determined by the usage context. For almost all cases this defaults to `SUM_OVER_BATCH_SIZE`. When used in distribution strategy scope, outside of built-in training loops such as `tf.keras` `compile` and `fit`, we expect reduction value to be 'None' or 'SUM'. Using other values will raise an error.\r\n* Wraps losses passed to the `compile` API (strings and v1 losses) which are not instances of v2 `Loss` class in `LossWrapper` class. => All losses will now use `SUM_OVER_BATCH_SIZE` reduction as default.\r\n* Disable `run_eagerly` and distribution strategy if there are symbolic tensors added to the model using `add_metric` or `add_loss`.\r\n* tf.linspace(start, stop, num) now always uses \"stop\" as last value (for num > 1)\r\n* The behavior of tf.gather is now correct when axis=None and batch_dims<0.\r\n* Only create a GCS directory object if the object does not already exist.\r\n* In `map_vectorization` optimization, reduce the degree of parallelism in the vectorized map node.\r\n* Bug fix: loss and gradients should now more reliably be correctly scaled w.r.t. the global batch size when using a tf.distribute.Strategy.\r\n* Updating cosine similarity loss - removed the negate sign from cosine similarity.\r\n* DType is no longer convertible to an int. Use dtype.as_datatype_enum instead of int(dtype) to get the same result.\r\n* Changed default for gradient accumulation for TPU embeddings to true.\r\n* Callbacks now log values in eager mode when a deferred build model is used.\r\n* Transitive dependencies on :pooling_ops were removed.  Some users may need to add explicit dependencies on :pooling_ops if they reference the operators from that library.\r\n\r\n## Bug Fixes and Other Changes\r\n* Documentation\r\n* Deprecations and Symbol renames.\r\n  * The GPU configuration env parameter `TF_CUDA_HOST_MEM_LIMIT_IN_MB` has been changed to `TF_GPU_HOST_MEM_LIMIT_IN_MB`.\r\n  * Remove unused StringViewVariantWrapper\r\n  * Delete unused Fingerprint64Map op registration\r\n  * SignatureDef util functions have been deprecated.\r\n  * Renamed tf.image functions to remove duplicate \"image\" where it is redundant.\r\n  * tf.keras.experimental.export renamed to tf.keras.experimental.export_saved_model\r\n  * Standardize the LayerNormalization API by replacing the args `norm_axis` and `params_axis` with `axis`.\r\n  * Tensor::UnsafeCopyFromInternal deprecated in favor Tensor::BitcastFrom\r\n* Keras & Python API\r\n  * Add v2 module aliases for:\r\n    * tf.initializers => tf.keras.initializers\r\n    * tf.losses => tf.keras.losses & tf.metrics => tf.keras.metrics\r\n    * tf.optimizers => tf.keras.optimizers\r\n  * Add tf.keras.layers.AbstractRNNCell as the preferred implementation of RNN cell for TF v2. User can use it to implement RNN cell with custom behavior.\r\n  * Adding `clear_losses` API to be able to clear losses at the end of forward pass in a custom training loop in eager.\r\n  * Add support for passing list of lists to the `metrics` param in Keras `compile`.\r\n  * Added top-k to precision and recall to keras metrics.\r\n  * Adding public APIs for `cumsum` and `cumprod` keras backend functions.\r\n  * Fix: model.add_loss(symbolic_tensor) should work in ambient eager.\r\n  * Add name argument to tf.string_split and tf.strings_split\r\n  * Minor change to SavedModels exported from Keras using tf.keras.experimental.export. (SignatureDef key for evaluation mode is now \"eval\" instead of \"test\"). This will be reverted back to \"test\" in the near future.\r\n  * Updates binary cross entropy logic in Keras when input is probabilities. Instead of converting probabilities to logits, we are using the cross entropy formula for probabilities.\r\n  * Raw TensorFlow functions can now be used in conjunction with the Keras Functional API during model creation. This obviates the need for users to create Lambda layers in most cases when using the Functional API. Like Lambda layers, TensorFlow functions that result in Variable creation or assign ops are not supported.\r\n  * Keras training and validation curves are shown on the same plot.\r\n  * Introduce `dynamic` constructor argument in Layer and Model, which should be set to True when using imperative control flow in the `call` method.\r\n  * Removing of dtype in the constructor of initializers and partition_info in call.\r\n* New ops and improved op functionality\r\n  * Add OpKernels for some stateless maps\r\n  * Add v2 APIs for AUCCurve and AUCSummationMethod enums. #tf-metrics-convergence\r\n  * Add tf.math.nextafter op.\r\n  * Add CompositeTensor base class.\r\n  * Add tf.linalg.tridiagonal_solve op.\r\n  * Add opkernel templates for common table operations.\r\n  * Added GPU implementation of tf.linalg.tridiagonal_solve.\r\n  * Added support for TFLite in TensorFlow 2.0.\r\n  * Adds summary trace API for collecting graph and profile information.\r\n  * Add batch_dims argument to tf.gather.\r\n  * Add support for `add_metric` in the graph function mode.\r\n  * Add C++ Gradient for BatchMatMulV2.\r\n  * Added tf.random.binomial\r\n  * Added gradient for SparseToDense op.\r\n  * Add legacy string flat hash map op kernels\r\n  * Add a ragged size op and register it to the op dispatcher\r\n  * Add broadcasting support to tf.matmul.\r\n  * Add ellipsis (...) support for tf.einsum()\r\n  * Added LinearOperator.adjoint and LinearOperator.H (alias).\r\n  * Added GPU implementation of tf.linalg.tridiagonal_solve.\r\n  * Added strings.byte_split\r\n  * Add RaggedTensor.placeholder()\r\n  * Add a new \"result_type\" parameter to tf.strings.split\r\n  * `add_update` can now be passed a zero-arg callable in order to support turning off the update when setting `trainable=False` on a Layer of a Model compiled with `run_eagerly=True`.\r\n  * Add variant wrapper for absl::string_view\r\n  * Add expand_composites argument to all nest.* methods.\r\n  * Add pfor converter for Squeeze.\r\n  * Bug fix for tf.tile gradient\r\n  * Expose CriticalSection in core as tf.CriticalSection.\r\n  * Update Fingerprint64Map to use aliases\r\n  * ResourceVariable support for gather_nd.\r\n  * ResourceVariable's gather op supports batch dimensions.\r\n  * Variadic reduce is supported on CPU\r\n  * Extend tf.function with basic support for CompositeTensors arguments (such as SparseTensor and RaggedTensor).\r\n  * Add templates and interfaces for creating lookup tables\r\n  * Post-training quantization tool supports quantizing weights shared by multiple operations. The models made with versions of this tool will use INT8 types for weights and will only be executable interpreters from this version onwards.\r\n  * Malformed gif images could result in an access out of bounds in the color palette of the frame. This has been fixed now\r\n  * image.resize now considers proper pixel centers and has new kernels (incl. anti-aliasing).\r\n* Performance\r\n  * Turn on MKL-DNN contraction kernels by default. MKL-DNN dynamically dispatches the best kernel implementation based on CPU vector architecture. To disable them, build with --define=tensorflow_mkldnn_contraction_kernel=0.\r\n  * Support for multi-host ncclAllReduce in Distribution Strategy.\r\n  * Expose a flag that allows the number of threads to vary across Python benchmarks.\r\n* TensorFlow 2.0 Development\r\n  * Add v2 sparse categorical crossentropy metric.\r\n  * Allow non-Tensors through v2 losses.\r\n  * Add UnifiedGRU as the new GRU implementation for tf2.0. Change the default recurrent activation function for GRU from 'hard_sigmoid' to 'sigmoid', and 'reset_after' to True in 2.0. Historically recurrent activation is 'hard_sigmoid' since it is fast than 'sigmoid'. With new unified backend between CPU and GPU mode, since the CuDNN kernel is using sigmoid, we change the default for CPU mode to sigmoid as well. With that, the default GRU will be compatible with both CPU and GPU kernel. This will enable user with GPU to use CuDNN kernel by default and get a 10x performance boost in training. Note that this is checkpoint breaking change. If user want to use their 1.x pre-trained checkpoint, please construct the layer with GRU(recurrent_activation='hard_sigmoid', reset_after=False) to fallback to 1.x behavior.\r\n  * TF 2.0 - Update metric name to always reflect what the user has given in compile. Affects following cases 1. When name is given as 'accuracy'/'crossentropy' 2. When an aliased function name is used eg. 'mse' 3. Removing the `weighted` prefix from weighted metric names.\r\n  * Begin adding Go wrapper for C Eager API\r\n  * image.resize in 2.0 now supports gradients for the new resize kernels.\r\n  * removed tf.string_split from v2 API\r\n  * Expose tf.contrib.proto.* ops in tf.io (they will exist in TF2)\r\n  * \"Updates the TFLiteConverter API in 2.0. Changes from_concrete_function to from_concrete_functions.\"\r\n  * Enable tf.distribute.experimental.MultiWorkerMirroredStrategy working in eager mode.\r\n  * Support both binary and -1/1 label input in v2 hinge and squared hinge losses.\r\n* TensorFlow Lite\r\n  * \"Adds support for tflite_convert in 2.0.\"\r\n  * \"Remove lite.OpHint, lite.experimental, and lite.constant from 2.0 API.\"\r\n* tf.contrib\r\n  * Added Neural Turing Implementation as described in https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.08518.\r\n  * Remove tf.contrib.timeseries dependency on TF distributions.\r\n* tf.data\r\n  * Add num_parallel_reads and passing in a Dataset containing filenames into TextLineDataset and FixedLengthRecordDataset\r\n  * Going forward we operate in TF 2.0, this change is part of the effort to slowly converting XYZDataset to DatasetV2 type which is the official version going to be used in TF 2.0 and motivated by some compatibility issue found, _BigtableXYZDataset (of type DatasetV2) does not implement the _as_variant_tensor() of DatasetV1, when moving contrib.bigtable to tensorflow_io. Converting into DatasetV2 removes the overheads to maintain V1 while we are moving into TF 2.0.\r\n  * Add dataset ops to the graph (or create kernels in Eager execution) during the python Dataset object creation instead doing it during Iterator creation time.\r\n  * Add support for TensorArrays to tf.data Dataset.\r\n  * Switching tf.data functions to use `defun`, providing an escape hatch to continue using the legacy `Defun`.\r\n* Toolchains\r\n  * CUDNN_INSTALL_PATH, TENSORRT_INSTALL_PATH, NCCL_INSTALL_PATH, NCCL_HDR_PATH are deprecated. Use TF_CUDA_PATHS instead which supports a comma-separated list of base paths that are searched to find CUDA libraries and headers.\r\n  * TF code now resides in `tensorflow_core` and `tensorflow` is just a virtual pip package. No code changes are needed for projects using TensorFlow, the change is transparent\r\n* XLA\r\n  * XLA HLO graphs can be inspected with interactive_graphviz tool now.\r\n  * Adds Philox support to new stateful RNG's XLA path.\r\n* Estimator\r\n  * Use `tf.compat.v1.estimator.inputs` instead of `tf.estimator.inputs`\r\n  * Replace `contrib` references with `tf.estimator.experimental.*` for APIs in `early_stopping.py`\r\n  * Determining the “correct” value of the `--iterations_per_loop` for TPUEstimator or DistributionStrategy continues to be a challenge for our users. We propose dynamically tuning the `--iterations_per_loop` variable, specifically for using TPUEstimator in training mode, based on a user target TPU execution time. Users might specify a value such as: `--iterations_per_loop=300s`, which will result in roughly 300 seconds being spent on the TPU between host side operations.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Thanks to our Contributors\r\n\r\nThis release contains contributions from many people at Google, as well as:\r\n\r\n1e100, 4d55397500, a6802739, abenmao, Adam Richter, Adam Weiss, Ag Ramesh, Alan Du, Albin Joy, Alex, Aman Patel, Amit, Amit Kumar Jaiswal, Amit Srivastava, Andreas Eberle, Andy Craze, Anthony Hsu, Anthony Platanios, Anuj Rawat, Armen Poghosov, armenpoghosov, arp95, Arpit Shah, Ashwin Ramaswami, Augustina Ragwitz, Aurelien Geron, AuréLien Geron, avasid, aweers, awesomealex1, Ayush Agrawal, Bayberry Z, Ben Barsdell, Bharat Raghunathan, Bhavani Subramanian, Bin Fan, blairhan, BléNesi Attila, Bodin-E, Brandon Carter, candy.dc, Cheng Chang, Chao Liu, chenchc, chie8842, Christian Hansen, Christian Sigg,  Christoph Boeddeker, Clayne Robison, crafet, csukuangfj, ctiijima, Dan Jarvis, Dan Lazewatsky, Daniel Ingram, Daniel Rasmussen, Daniel Salvadori, Dave Airlie, David Norman, Dayananda V, Dayananda-V, delock, Denis Khalikov, Deven Desai, Dheeraj Rajaram Reddy, dmitrievanthony, Donovan Ong, Drew Szurko, Duncan Riach, Dustin Neighly, Edward Forgacs, EFanZh, Evgeniy Polyakov, Fangjun Kuang, Federico Martinez, Fei Hu, Felix Lemke, Filip Matzner, fo40225, Fred Reiss, Gautam, gehring, Geoffrey Irving, George Sterpu, Grzegorz George Pawelczak, Grzegorz Pawelczak, Gurpreet Singh, Gyoung-Yoon Ryoo, HanGuo97, Hanton Yang, Hari Shankar, hehongliang, Heungsub Lee, Hoeseong Kim, Huan Li (李卓桓), I-Hong Jhuo, Ilango R, Innovimax, Irene Dea, Jacky Ko, Jakub Lipinski, Jason Zaman, jcf94, Jeffrey Poznanovic, Jens Elofsson, Jeroen BéDorf, jhalakp, Jia Qingtong, Jiankang, Joe Q, Joe Quadrino, Joeran Beel, Jonas Rauber, Jonathan, Jonathan Kyl, Joppe Geluykens, Joseph Friedman, jtressle, jwu, K Yasaswi Sri Chandra Gandhi, K.

    "body": "# Release 1.14.0\r\n\r\n## Major Features and Improvements\r\n\r\n* This is the first 1.x release containing the compat.v2 module. This module is required to allow libraries to publish code which works in both 1.x and 2.x. After this release, no backwards incompatible changes are allowed in the 2.0 Python API.\r\n* Turn on MKL-DNN contraction kernels by default. MKL-DNN dynamically dispatches the best kernel implementation based on CPU vector architecture. To disable them, build with --define=tensorflow_mkldnn_contraction_kernel=0.\r\n* Non-Windows system libraries are now versioned. This should be a no-op for most users as it affects only system package maintainers or those building extensions to TensorFlow:\r\n * Python wheels (Pip packages) contain one library file.\r\n   * Linux: `libtensorflow_framework.so.1`\r\n   * MacOS: `libtensorflow_framework.1.dylib`\r\n * Our `libtensorflow` tarball archives contain the `libtensorflow` library and two symlinks. MacOS `.dylib` libraries are the same, but match MacOS library naming requirements (i.e. `libtensorflow.1.dylib`):\r\n   * `libtensorflow.so.1.14.0`, the main library\r\n   * `libtensorflow.so.1`, symlinked to the main library\r\n   * `libtensorflow.so`, symlinked to `.so.1`\r\n\r\n## Behavioral changes\r\n\r\n* Set default loss reduction as `AUTO` for improving reliability of loss scaling with distribution strategy and custom training loops. `AUTO` indicates that the reduction option will be determined by the usage context. For almost all cases this defaults to `SUM_OVER_BATCH_SIZE`. When used in distribution strategy scope, outside of built-in training loops such as `tf.keras` `compile` and `fit`, we expect reduction value to be 'None' or 'SUM'. Using other values will raise an error.\r\n* Wraps losses passed to the `compile` API (strings and v1 losses) which are not instances of v2 `Loss` class in `LossWrapper` class. => All losses will now use `SUM_OVER_BATCH_SIZE` reduction as default.\r\n* Disable `run_eagerly` and distribution strategy if there are symbolic tensors added to the model using `add_metric` or `add_loss`.\r\n* tf.linspace(start, stop, num) now always uses \"stop\" as last value (for num > 1)\r\n* The behavior of tf.gather is now correct when axis=None and batch_dims<0.\r\n* Only create a GCS directory object if the object does not already exist.\r\n* In `map_vectorization` optimization, reduce the degree of parallelism in the vectorized map node.\r\n* Bug fix: loss and gradients should now more reliably be correctly scaled w.r.t. the global batch size when using a tf.distribute.Strategy.\r\n* Updating cosine similarity loss - removed the negate sign from cosine similarity.\r\n* DType is no longer convertible to an int. Use dtype.as_datatype_enum instead of int(dtype) to get the same result.\r\n* Changed default for gradient accumulation for TPU embeddings to true.\r\n* Callbacks now log values in eager mode when a deferred build model is used.\r\n* Transitive dependencies on :pooling_ops were removed.  Some users may need to add explicit dependencies on :pooling_ops if they reference the operators from that library.\r\n\r\n## Bug Fixes and Other Changes\r\n* Documentation\r\n* Deprecations and Symbol renames.\r\n  * Remove unused StringViewVariantWrapper\r\n  * Delete unused Fingerprint64Map op registration\r\n  * SignatureDef util functions have been deprecated.\r\n  * Renamed tf.image functions to remove duplicate \"image\" where it is redundant.\r\n  * tf.keras.experimental.export renamed to tf.keras.experimental.export_saved_model\r\n  * Standardize the LayerNormalization API by replacing the args `norm_axis` and `params_axis` with `axis`.\r\n  * Tensor::UnsafeCopyFromInternal deprecated in favor Tensor::BitcastFrom\r\n* Keras & Python API\r\n  * Add v2 module aliases for:\r\n    * tf.initializers => tf.keras.initializers\r\n    * tf.losses => tf.keras.losses & tf.metrics => tf.keras.metrics\r\n    * tf.optimizers => tf.keras.optimizers\r\n  * Add tf.keras.layers.AbstractRNNCell as the preferred implementation of RNN cell for TF v2. User can use it to implement RNN cell with custom behavior.\r\n  * Adding `clear_losses` API to be able to clear losses at the end of forward pass in a custom training loop in eager.\r\n  * Add support for passing list of lists to the `metrics` param in Keras `compile`.\r\n  * Added top-k to precision and recall to keras metrics.\r\n  * Adding public APIs for `cumsum` and `cumprod` keras backend functions.\r\n  * Fix: model.add_loss(symbolic_tensor) should work in ambient eager.\r\n  * Add name argument to tf.string_split and tf.strings_split\r\n  * Minor change to SavedModels exported from Keras using tf.keras.experimental.export. (SignatureDef key for evaluation mode is now \"eval\" instead of \"test\"). This will be reverted back to \"test\" in the near future.\r\n  * Updates binary cross entropy logic in Keras when input is probabilities. Instead of converting probabilities to logits, we are using the cross entropy formula for probabilities.\r\n  * Raw TensorFlow functions can now be used in conjunction with the Keras Functional API during model creation. This obviates the need for users to create Lambda layers in most cases when using the Functional API. Like Lambda layers, TensorFlow functions that result in Variable creation or assign ops are not supported.\r\n  * Keras training and validation curves are shown on the same plot.\r\n  * Introduce `dynamic` constructor argument in Layer and Model, which should be set to True when using imperative control flow in the `call` method.\r\n  * Removing of dtype in the constructor of initializers and partition_info in call.\r\n* New ops and improved op functionality\r\n  * Add OpKernels for some stateless maps\r\n  * Add v2 APIs for AUCCurve and AUCSummationMethod enums. #tf-metrics-convergence\r\n  * Add tf.math.nextafter op.\r\n  * Add CompositeTensor base class.\r\n  * Add tf.linalg.tridiagonal_solve op.\r\n  * Add opkernel templates for common table operations.\r\n  * Added support for TFLite in TensorFlow 2.0.\r\n  * Adds summary trace API for collecting graph and profile information.\r\n  * Add batch_dims argument to tf.gather.\r\n  * Add support for `add_metric` in the graph function mode.\r\n  * Add C++ Gradient for BatchMatMulV2.\r\n  * Added tf.random.binomial\r\n  * Added gradient for SparseToDense op.\r\n  * Add legacy string flat hash map op kernels\r\n  * Add a ragged size op and register it to the op dispatcher\r\n  * Add broadcasting support to tf.matmul.\r\n  * Add ellipsis (...) support for tf.einsum()\r\n  * Added LinearOperator.adjoint and LinearOperator.H (alias).\r\n  * Added GPU implementation of tf.linalg.tridiagonal_solve.\r\n  * Added strings.byte_split\r\n  * Add RaggedTensor.placeholder()\r\n  * Add a new \"result_type\" parameter to tf.strings.split\r\n  * `add_update` can now be passed a zero-arg callable in order to support turning off the update when setting `trainable=False` on a Layer of a Model compiled with `run_eagerly=True`.\r\n  * Add variant wrapper for absl::string_view\r\n  * Add expand_composites argument to all nest.* methods.\r\n  * Add pfor converter for Squeeze.\r\n  * Bug fix for tf.tile gradient\r\n  * Expose CriticalSection in core as tf.CriticalSection.\r\n  * Update Fingerprint64Map to use aliases\r\n  * ResourceVariable support for gather_nd.\r\n  * ResourceVariable's gather op supports batch dimensions.\r\n  * Variadic reduce is supported on CPU\r\n  * Extend tf.function with basic support for CompositeTensors arguments (such as SparseTensor and RaggedTensor).\r\n  * Add templates and interfaces for creating lookup tables\r\n  * Post-training quantization tool supports quantizing weights shared by multiple operations. The models made with versions of this tool will use INT8 types for weights and will only be executable interpreters from this version onwards.\r\n  * Malformed gif images could result in an access out of bounds in the color palette of the frame. This has been fixed now\r\n  * image.resize now considers proper pixel centers and has new kernels (incl. anti-aliasing).\r\n* Performance\r\n  * Turn on MKL-DNN contraction kernels by default. MKL-DNN dynamically dispatches the best kernel implementation based on CPU vector architecture. To disable them, build with --define=tensorflow_mkldnn_contraction_kernel=0.\r\n  * Support for multi-host ncclAllReduce in Distribution Strategy.\r\n  * Expose a flag that allows the number of threads to vary across Python benchmarks.\r\n* TensorFlow 2.0 Development\r\n  * Add v2 sparse categorical crossentropy metric.\r\n  * Allow non-Tensors through v2 losses.\r\n  * Add UnifiedGRU as the new GRU implementation for tf2.0. Change the default recurrent activation function for GRU from 'hard_sigmoid' to 'sigmoid', and 'reset_after' to True in 2.0. Historically recurrent activation is 'hard_sigmoid' since it is fast than 'sigmoid'. With new unified backend between CPU and GPU mode, since the CuDNN kernel is using sigmoid, we change the default for CPU mode to sigmoid as well. With that, the default GRU will be compatible with both CPU and GPU kernel. This will enable user with GPU to use CuDNN kernel by default and get a 10x performance boost in training. Note that this is checkpoint breaking change. If user want to use their 1.x pre-trained checkpoint, please construct the layer with GRU(recurrent_activation='hard_sigmoid', reset_after=False) to fallback to 1.x behavior.\r\n  * TF 2.0 - Update metric name to always reflect what the user has given in compile. Affects following cases 1. When name is given as 'accuracy'/'crossentropy' 2. When an aliased function name is used eg. 'mse' 3. Removing the `weighted` prefix from weighted metric names.\r\n  * Begin adding Go wrapper for C Eager API\r\n  * image.resize in 2.0 now supports gradients for the new resize kernels.\r\n  * removed tf.string_split from v2 API\r\n  * Expose tf.contrib.proto.* ops in tf.io (they will exist in TF2)\r\n  * \"Updates the TFLiteConverter API in 2.0. Changes from_concrete_function to from_concrete_functions.\"\r\n  * Enable tf.distribute.experimental.MultiWorkerMirroredStrategy working in eager mode.\r\n  * Support both binary and -1/1 label input in v2 hinge and squared hinge losses.\r\n* TensorFlow Lite\r\n  * \"Adds support for tflite_convert in 2.0.\"\r\n  * \"Remove lite.OpHint, lite.experimental, and lite.constant from 2.0 API.\"\r\n* tf.contrib\r\n  * Added Neural Turing Implementation as described in https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.08518.\r\n  * Remove tf.contrib.timeseries dependency on TF distributions.\r\n* tf.data\r\n  * Add num_parallel_reads and passing in a Dataset containing filenames into TextLineDataset and FixedLengthRecordDataset\r\n  * Going forward we operate in TF 2.0, this change is part of the effort to slowly converting XYZDataset to DatasetV2 type which is the official version going to be used in TF 2.0 and motivated by some compatibility issue found, _BigtableXYZDataset (of type DatasetV2) does not implement the _as_variant_tensor() of DatasetV1, when moving contrib.bigtable to tensorflow_io. Converting into DatasetV2 removes the overheads to maintain V1 while we are moving into TF 2.0.\r\n  * Add dataset ops to the graph (or create kernels in Eager execution) during the python Dataset object creation instead doing it during Iterator creation time.\r\n  * Add support for TensorArrays to tf.data Dataset.\r\n  * Switching tf.data functions to use `defun`, providing an escape hatch to continue using the legacy `Defun`.\r\n* Toolchains\r\n  * CUDNN_INSTALL_PATH, TENSORRT_INSTALL_PATH, NCCL_INSTALL_PATH, NCCL_HDR_PATH are deprecated. Use TF_CUDA_PATHS instead which supports a comma-separated list of base paths that are searched to find CUDA libraries and headers.\r\n  * TF code now resides in `tensorflow_core` and `tensorflow` is just a virtual pip package. No code changes are needed for projects using TensorFlow, the change is transparent\r\n* XLA\r\n  * XLA HLO graphs can be inspected with interactive_graphviz tool now.\r\n* Estimator\r\n  * Use `tf.compat.v1.estimator.inputs` instead of `tf.estimator.inputs`\r\n  * Replace `contrib` references with `tf.estimator.experimental.*` for APIs in `early_stopping.py`\r\n  * Determining the “correct” value of the `--iterations_per_loop` for TPUEstimator or DistributionStrategy continues to be a challenge for our users. We propose dynamically tuning the `--iterations_per_loop` variable, specifically for using TPUEstimator in training mode, based on a user target TPU execution time. Users might specify a value such as: `--iterations_per_loop=300s`, which will result in roughly 300 seconds being spent on the TPU between host side operations.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Thanks to our Contributors\r\n\r\nThis release contains contributions from many people at Google, as well as:\r\n\r\n1e100, 4d55397500, a6802739, abenmao, Adam Weiss, Ag Ramesh, Alan Du, Albin Joy, Alex, Aman Patel, Amit, Amit Kumar Jaiswal, Amit Srivastava, Andreas Eberle, Andy Craze, Anthony Platanios, Armen Poghosov, armenpoghosov, arp95, Arpit Shah, Ashwin Ramaswami, Aurelien Geron, AuréLien Geron, aweers, awesomealex1, Ayush Agrawal, Ben Barsdell, Bharat Raghunathan, Bhavani Subramanian, blairhan, BléNesi Attila, Brandon Carter, candy.dc, Chao Liu, chenchc, chie8842, Christian Hansen, Christian Sigg, Clayne Robison, crafet, csukuangfj, ctiijima, Dan Jarvis, Dan Lazewatsky, Daniel Ingram, Daniel Salvadori, Dave Airlie, David Norman, Dayananda V, Dayananda-V, delock, Denis Khalikov, Deven Desai, Dheeraj Rajaram Reddy, dmitrievanthony, Donovan Ong, Drew Szurko, Duncan Riach, Dustin Neighly, Edward Forgacs, EFanZh, Fei Hu, Felix Lemke, Filip Matzner, fo40225, frreiss, Gautam, gehring, Geoffrey Irving, Grzegorz George Pawelczak, Grzegorz Pawelczak, Gyoung-Yoon Ryoo, HanGuo97, Hanton Yang, Hari Shankar, hehongliang, Heungsub Lee, Hoeseong Kim, I-Hong Jhuo, Ilango R, Innovimax, Irene Dea, Jacky Ko, Jakub Lipinski, Jason Zaman, jcf94, Jeffrey Poznanovic, Jens Elofsson, Jeroen BéDorf, Jia Qingtong, Jiankang, Joe Q, Joe Quadrino, Joeran Beel, Jonas Rauber, Jonathan, Jonathan Kyl, Joppe Geluykens, Joseph Friedman, jtressle, jwu, K Yasaswi Sri Chandra Gandhi, K.

    "body": "# Release 2.0.0-beta0\r\n\r\n## Major Features and Improvements\r\n\r\nTensorFlow 2.0 focuses on **simplicity** and **ease of use**, featuring updates like:\r\n\r\n* Easy model building with Keras and eager execution\r\n* Robust model deployment in production on any platform\r\n* Powerful experimentation for research\r\n* API simplification by reducing duplication and removing deprecated endpoints\r\n\r\nThe feature improvements, fixes noted here are post TF 2.0 Alpha release. Please refer to [Alpha release notes](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/releases/tag/v2.0.0-alpha0) in case you missed it.\r\n\r\nFor information on upgrading your existing TensorFlow 1.x models, please refer to our [Upgrade](https://medium.com/tensorflow/upgrading-your-code-to-tensorflow-2-0-f72c3a4d83b5) and [Migration](https://github.com/tensorflow/docs/blob/master/site/en/r2/guide/migration_guide.ipynb) guides.\r\nWe have also released a collection of [tutorials and getting started guides](https://www.tensorflow.org/beta), and an [Effective Style Guide for TF 2.0](https://github.com/tensorflow/docs/blob/master/site/en/r2/guide/effective_tf2.md)\r\nFor more information on these community-driven changes, be sure to check out the [RFCs](https://github.com/tensorflow/community/tree/master/rfcs) we have on Github. If you care about details, all of the RFCs are important.\r\n\r\n## Highlights\r\n\r\n* Distribution Strategy: TF 2.0 users will be able to use the new [`tf.distribute.Strategy`](https://www.tensorflow.org/beta/guide/distribute_strategy) API to distribute training with minimal code changes, yielding good out-of-the-box performance. We have more strategies supported in the beta release, as well as improved support for custom training loops and Keras subclassed models. Check out the [guide](https://www.tensorflow.org/beta/guide/distribute_strategy) to see what’s supported now.\r\n* API Freeze: Symbol renaming/deprecation and 2.0 API changes are complete. 2.0 API is final and is also available as part of the [TensorFlow 1.14 release](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/releases/tag/v1.14.0-rc0) in compat.v2 module. A list of all symbol changes can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FLFJLzg7WNP6JHODX5q8BDgptKafq_slHpnHVbJIteQ/edit#gid=0)\r\n\r\n## Breaking Changes\r\n\r\n* `tf.contrib` has been deprecated, and functionality has been either migrated to the core TensorFlow API, to [tensorflow/addons](https://www.github.com/tensorflow/addons), or removed entirely.\r\n* Premade estimators in the tf.estimator.DNN/Linear/DNNLinearCombined family have been updated to use `tf.keras.optimizers` instead of the `tf.compat.v1.train.Optimizer`s. If you do not pass in an `optimizer=` arg or if you use a string, the premade estimator will use the keras optimizer. This is checkpoint breaking, as the optimizers have separate variables. A checkpoint converter tool for converting optimizers is included with the release,  but if you want to avoid any change, switch to the v1 version of the estimator:  `tf.compat.v1.estimator.DNN/Linear/DNNLinearCombined*`.\r\n\r\nRefer to our [public project status tracker](https://github.com/orgs/tensorflow/projects/4) and [issues tagged with `2.0`](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A2.0) on GitHub for insight into recent issues and development progress.\r\n\r\nIf you experience any snags when using TF 2.0, please let us know at the [TF 2.0 Testing User Group](https://groups.google.com/a/tensorflow.org/forum/?utm_medium=email&utm_source=footer#!forum/testing). We have a support mailing list as well as weekly testing meetings, and would love to hear your migration feedback and questions.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Bug Fixes and Other Changes\r\n\r\n* `tf.data`:\r\n  * Adds option for introducing slack in the pipeline to reduce CPU contention, via `options =    `tf.data.Options()`; `options.experimental_slack = True; dataset = dataset.with_options(options)`\r\n  * Removing the `experimental_numa_aware` option from `tf.data.Options`.\r\n  * Add support for TensorArrays to `tf.data Dataset`.\r\n* `tf.keras`:\r\n  * Saving a Keras Model using `tf.saved_model.save` now saves the list of variables, trainable variables, regularization losses, and the call function.\r\n  * `tf.keras.estimator.model_to_estimator` now supports exporting to `tf.train.Checkpoint format`, which allows the saved checkpoints to be compatible with `model.load_weights`.\r\n  * `tf.keras.model.save_model` and `model.save` now defaults to saving a TensorFlow SavedModel.\r\n  * `OMP_NUM_THREADS` is no longer used by the default Keras config.  To configure the number of threads, use `tf.config.threading` APIs.\r\n  * Mark Keras `set_session` as `compat.v1` only\r\n* `tf.estimator`:\r\n  * Replace `tf.contrib.estimator.add_metrics` with `tf.estimator.add_metrics`\r\n* `tf.lite`:\r\n  * \"Update the TFLiteConverter API in 2.0. Changes from_concrete_function to from_concrete_functions.\"\r\n  * \"Add support for tflite_convert in 2.0.\"\r\n* `tf.contrib`:\r\n  * Expose tf.contrib.proto.* ops in tf.io (they will exist in TF2)\r\n* Other:\r\n  * Eliminate race condition during XLA convolution autotuning.\r\n  * Bug fix for `tf.tile` gradient\r\n  * TF code now resides in `tensorflow_core` and `tensorflow` is just a virtual pip package. No code changes are needed for projects using TensorFlow, the change is transparent.\r\n  * Added gradient for SparseToDense op.\r\n  * Expose a flag that allows the number of threads to vary across Python benchmarks.\r\n  * ResourceVariable's gather op supports batch dimensions.\r\n  * `image.resize` in 2.0 now supports gradients for the new resize kernels.\r\n  * removed `tf.string_split` from v2 API.\r\n  * Variadic reduce is supported on CPU Variadic reduce is supported on CPU\r\n  * Added GPU implementation of `tf.linalg.tridiagonal_solve`.\r\n  * Delete unused lookup table code.\r\n  * Going forward we operate in TF 2.0, this change is part of the effort to slowly converting XYZDataset to DatasetV2 type which is the official version going to be used in TF 2.0 and motivated by some compatibility issue found, `_BigtableXYZDataset` (of type `DatasetV2`) does not implement the `_as_variant_tensor()` of DatasetV1, when moving `contrib.bigtable` to `tensorflow_io`.

Use TF_CUDA_PATHS instead which supports a comma-separated list of base paths that are searched to find CUDA libraries and headers.\r\n  * Add RaggedTensor.placeholder()\r\n  * Add pfor converter for Squeeze.\r\n  * Renamed `tf.image` functions to remove duplicate \"image\" where it is redundant.\r\n  * Add C++ Gradient for BatchMatMulV2.\r\n  * Set default loss reduction as `AUTO` for improving reliability of loss scaling with distribution strategy and custom training loops. `AUTO` indicates that the reduction option will be determined by the usage context.

    "body": "# Release 1.14.0\r\n\r\n## Major Features and Improvements\r\n\r\n* This is the first 1.x release containing the compat.v2 module. This module is required to allow libraries to publish code which works in both 1.x and 2.x. After this release, no backwards incompatible changes are allowed in the 2.0 Python API.\r\n* Turn on MKL-DNN contraction kernels by default. MKL-DNN dynamically dispatches the best kernel implementation based on CPU vector architecture. To disable them, build with --define=tensorflow_mkldnn_contraction_kernel=0.\r\n\r\n## Behavioral changes\r\n\r\n* Set default loss reduction as `AUTO` for improving reliability of loss scaling with distribution strategy and custom training loops. `AUTO` indicates that the reduction option will be determined by the usage context. For almost all cases this defaults to `SUM_OVER_BATCH_SIZE`. When used in distribution strategy scope, outside of built-in training loops such as `tf.keras` `compile` and `fit`, we expect reduction value to be 'None' or 'SUM'. Using other values will raise an error.\r\n* Wraps losses passed to the `compile` API (strings and v1 losses) which are not instances of v2 `Loss` class in `LossWrapper` class. => All losses will now use `SUM_OVER_BATCH_SIZE` reduction as default.\r\n* Disable `run_eagerly` and distribution strategy if there are symbolic tensors added to the model using `add_metric` or `add_loss`.\r\n* tf.linspace(start, stop, num) now always uses \"stop\" as last value (for num > 1)\r\n* `ResourceVariable` and `Variable` no longer accepts `constraint` in the constructor, nor expose it as a @property.\r\n* The behavior of tf.gather is now correct when axis=None and batch_dims<0.\r\n* Only create a GCS directory object if the object does not already exist.\r\n* In `map_vectorization` optimization, reduce the degree of parallelism in the vectorized map node.\r\n* Bug fix: loss and gradients should now more reliably be correctly scaled w.r.t. the global batch size when using a tf.distribute.Strategy.\r\n* Updating cosine similarity loss - removed the negate sign from cosine similarity.\r\n* DType is no longer convertible to an int. Use dtype.as_datatype_enum instead of int(dtype) to get the same result.\r\n* Changed default for gradient accumulation for TPU embeddings to true.\r\n* Callbacks now log values in eager mode when a deferred build model is used.\r\n* Transitive dependencies on :pooling_ops were removed.  Some users may need to add explicit dependencies on :pooling_ops if they reference the operators from that library.\r\n\r\n## Bug Fixes and Other Changes\r\n* Documentation\r\n* Deprecations and Symbol renames.\r\n  * Remove unused StringViewVariantWrapper\r\n  * Delete unused Fingerprint64Map op registration\r\n  * SignatureDef util functions have been deprecated.\r\n  * Renamed tf.image functions to remove duplicate \"image\" where it is redundant.\r\n  * tf.keras.experimental.export renamed to tf.keras.experimental.export_saved_model\r\n  * Standardize the LayerNormalization API by replacing the args `norm_axis` and `params_axis` with `axis`.\r\n  * Tensor::UnsafeCopyFromInternal deprecated in favor Tensor::BitcastFrom\r\n* Keras & Python API\r\n  * Add v2 module aliases for:\r\n    * tf.initializers => tf.keras.initializers\r\n    * tf.losses => tf.keras.losses & tf.metrics => tf.keras.metrics\r\n    * tf.optimizers => tf.keras.optimizers\r\n  * Add tf.keras.layers.AbstractRNNCell as the preferred implementation of RNN cell for TF v2. User can use it to implement RNN cell with custom behavior.\r\n  * Adding `clear_losses` API to be able to clear losses at the end of forward pass in a custom training loop in eager.\r\n  * Add support for passing list of lists to the `metrics` param in Keras `compile`.\r\n  * Added top-k to precision and recall to keras metrics.\r\n  * Adding public APIs for `cumsum` and `cumprod` keras backend functions.\r\n  * Fix: model.add_loss(symbolic_tensor) should work in ambient eager.\r\n  * Add name argument to tf.string_split and tf.strings_split\r\n  * Minor change to SavedModels exported from Keras using tf.keras.experimental.export. (SignatureDef key for evaluation mode is now \"eval\" instead of \"test\"). This will be reverted back to \"test\" in the near future.\r\n  * Updates binary cross entropy logic in Keras when input is probabilities. Instead of converting probabilities to logits, we are using the cross entropy formula for probabilities.\r\n  * Raw TensorFlow functions can now be used in conjunction with the Keras Functional API during model creation. This obviates the need for users to create Lambda layers in most cases when using the Functional API. Like Lambda layers, TensorFlow functions that result in Variable creation or assign ops are not supported.\r\n  * Keras training and validation curves are shown on the same plot.\r\n  * Introduce `dynamic` constructor argument in Layer and Model, which should be set to True when using imperative control flow in the `call` method.\r\n  * Removing of dtype in the constructor of initializers and partition_info in call.\r\n* New ops and improved op functionality\r\n  * Add OpKernels for some stateless maps\r\n  * Add v2 APIs for AUCCurve and AUCSummationMethod enums. #tf-metrics-convergence\r\n  * Add tf.math.nextafter op.\r\n  * Add CompositeTensor base class.\r\n  * Add tf.linalg.tridiagonal_solve op.\r\n  * Add opkernel templates for common table operations.\r\n  * Added support for TFLite in TensorFlow 2.0.\r\n  * Adds summary trace API for collecting graph and profile information.\r\n  * Add batch_dims argument to tf.gather.\r\n  * Add support for `add_metric` in the graph function mode.\r\n  * Add C++ Gradient for BatchMatMulV2.\r\n  * Added tf.random.binomial\r\n  * Added gradient for SparseToDense op.\r\n  * Add legacy string flat hash map op kernels\r\n  * Add a ragged size op and register it to the op dispatcher\r\n  * Add broadcasting support to tf.matmul.\r\n  * Add ellipsis (...) support for tf.einsum()\r\n  * Added LinearOperator.adjoint and LinearOperator.H (alias).\r\n  * Added GPU implementation of tf.linalg.tridiagonal_solve.\r\n  * Added strings.byte_split\r\n  * Add RaggedTensor.placeholder()\r\n  * Add a new \"result_type\" parameter to tf.strings.split\r\n  * `add_update` can now be passed a zero-arg callable in order to support turning off the update when setting `trainable=False` on a Layer of a Model compiled with `run_eagerly=True`.\r\n  * Add variant wrapper for absl::string_view\r\n  * Add expand_composites argument to all nest.* methods.\r\n  * Add pfor converter for Squeeze.\r\n  * Bug fix for tf.tile gradient\r\n  * Expose CriticalSection in core as tf.CriticalSection.\r\n  * Update Fingerprint64Map to use aliases\r\n  * ResourceVariable support for gather_nd.\r\n  * ResourceVariable's gather op supports batch dimensions.\r\n  * Variadic reduce is supported on CPU\r\n  * Extend tf.function with basic support for CompositeTensors arguments (such as SparseTensor and RaggedTensor).\r\n  * Add templates and interfaces for creating lookup tables\r\n  * Post-training quantization tool supports quantizing weights shared by multiple operations. The models made with versions of this tool will use INT8 types for weights and will only be executable interpreters from this version onwards.\r\n  * Malformed gif images could result in an access out of bounds in the color palette of the frame. This has been fixed now\r\n  * image.resize now considers proper pixel centers and has new kernels (incl. anti-aliasing).\r\n* Performance\r\n  * Turn on MKL-DNN contraction kernels by default. MKL-DNN dynamically dispatches the best kernel implementation based on CPU vector architecture. To disable them, build with --define=tensorflow_mkldnn_contraction_kernel=0.\r\n  * Support for multi-host ncclAllReduce in Distribution Strategy.\r\n  * Expose a flag that allows the number of threads to vary across Python benchmarks.\r\n* TensorFlow 2.0 Development\r\n  * Add v2 sparse categorical crossentropy metric.\r\n  * Allow non-Tensors through v2 losses.\r\n  * Add UnifiedGRU as the new GRU implementation for tf2.0. Change the default recurrent activation function for GRU from 'hard_sigmoid' to 'sigmoid', and 'reset_after' to True in 2.0. Historically recurrent activation is 'hard_sigmoid' since it is fast than 'sigmoid'. With new unified backend between CPU and GPU mode, since the CuDNN kernel is using sigmoid, we change the default for CPU mode to sigmoid as well. With that, the default GRU will be compatible with both CPU and GPU kernel. This will enable user with GPU to use CuDNN kernel by default and get a 10x performance boost in training. Note that this is checkpoint breaking change. If user want to use their 1.x pre-trained checkpoint, please construct the layer with GRU(recurrent_activation='hard_sigmoid', reset_after=False) to fallback to 1.x behavior.\r\n  * TF 2.0 - Update metric name to always reflect what the user has given in compile. Affects following cases 1. When name is given as 'accuracy'/'crossentropy' 2. When an aliased function name is used eg. 'mse' 3. Removing the `weighted` prefix from weighted metric names.\r\n  * Begin adding Go wrapper for C Eager API\r\n  * image.resize in 2.0 now supports gradients for the new resize kernels.\r\n  * removed tf.string_split from v2 API\r\n  * Expose tf.contrib.proto.* ops in tf.io (they will exist in TF2)\r\n  * \"Updates the TFLiteConverter API in 2.0. Changes from_concrete_function to from_concrete_functions.\"\r\n  * Enable tf.distribute.experimental.MultiWorkerMirroredStrategy working in eager mode.\r\n  * Support both binary and -1/1 label input in v2 hinge and squared hinge losses.\r\n* TensorFlow Lite\r\n  * \"Adds support for tflite_convert in 2.0.\"\r\n  * \"Remove lite.OpHint, lite.experimental, and lite.constant from 2.0 API.\"\r\n* tf.contrib\r\n  * Added Neural Turing Implementation as described in https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.08518.\r\n  * Remove tf.contrib.timeseries dependency on TF distributions.\r\n* tf.data\r\n  * Add num_parallel_reads and passing in a Dataset containing filenames into TextLineDataset and FixedLengthRecordDataset\r\n  * Going forward we operate in TF 2.0, this change is part of the effort to slowly converting XYZDataset to DatasetV2 type which is the official version going to be used in TF 2.0 and motivated by some compatibility issue found, _BigtableXYZDataset (of type DatasetV2) does not implement the _as_variant_tensor() of DatasetV1, when moving contrib.bigtable to tensorflow_io. Converting into DatasetV2 removes the overheads to maintain V1 while we are moving into TF 2.0.\r\n  * Add dataset ops to the graph (or create kernels in Eager execution) during the python Dataset object creation instead doing it during Iterator creation time.\r\n  * Add support for TensorArrays to tf.data Dataset.\r\n  * Switching tf.data functions to use `defun`, providing an escape hatch to continue using the legacy `Defun`.\r\n* Toolchains\r\n  * CUDNN_INSTALL_PATH, TENSORRT_INSTALL_PATH, NCCL_INSTALL_PATH, NCCL_HDR_PATH are deprecated. Use TF_CUDA_PATHS instead which supports a comma-separated list of base paths that are searched to find CUDA libraries and headers.\r\n  * TF code now resides in `tensorflow_core` and `tensorflow` is just a virtual pip package. No code changes are needed for projects using TensorFlow, the change is transparent\r\n* XLA\r\n  * XLA HLO graphs can be inspected with interactive_graphviz tool now.\r\n* Estimator\r\n  * Use tf.compat.v1.estimator.inputs instead of tf.estimator.inputs\r\n  * Replace contrib references with tf.estimator.experimental.* for apis in early_stopping.py\r\n\r\n\r\n## Thanks to our Contributors\r\n\r\nThis release contains contributions from many people at Google, as well as:\r\n\r\n1e100, 4d55397500, a6802739, abenmao, Adam Weiss, Ag Ramesh, Alan Du, Albin Joy, Alex, Aman Patel, Amit, Amit Kumar Jaiswal, Amit Srivastava, Andreas Eberle, Andy Craze, Anthony Platanios, Armen Poghosov, armenpoghosov, arp95, Arpit Shah, Ashwin Ramaswami, Aurelien Geron, AuréLien Geron, aweers, awesomealex1, Ayush Agrawal, Ben Barsdell, Bharat Raghunathan, Bhavani Subramanian, blairhan, BléNesi Attila, Brandon Carter, candy.dc, Chao Liu, chenchc, chie8842, Christian Hansen, Christian Sigg, Clayne Robison, crafet, csukuangfj, ctiijima, Dan Jarvis, Dan Lazewatsky, Daniel Ingram, Daniel Salvadori, Dave Airlie, David Norman, Dayananda V, Dayananda-V, delock, Denis Khalikov, Deven Desai, Dheeraj Rajaram Reddy, dmitrievanthony, Donovan Ong, Drew Szurko, Duncan Riach, Dustin Neighly, Edward Forgacs, EFanZh, Fei Hu, Felix Lemke, Filip Matzner, fo40225, frreiss, Gautam, gehring, Geoffrey Irving, Grzegorz George Pawelczak, Grzegorz Pawelczak, Gyoung-Yoon Ryoo, HanGuo97, Hanton Yang, Hari Shankar, hehongliang, Heungsub Lee, Hoeseong Kim, I-Hong Jhuo, Ilango R, Innovimax, Irene Dea, Jacky Ko, Jakub Lipinski, Jason Zaman, jcf94, Jeffrey Poznanovic, Jens Elofsson, Jeroen BéDorf, Jia Qingtong, Jiankang, Joe Q, Joe Quadrino, Joeran Beel, Jonas Rauber, Jonathan, Jonathan Kyl, Joppe Geluykens, Joseph Friedman, jtressle, jwu, K Yasaswi Sri Chandra Gandhi, K.

    "body": "# Release 2.0.0-alpha0\r\n\r\n## Major Features and Improvements\r\n\r\nTensorFlow 2.0 focuses on **simplicity** and **ease of use**, featuring updates like:\r\n\r\n* Easy model building with Keras and eager execution.\r\n* Robust model deployment in production on any platform.\r\n* Powerful experimentation for research.\r\n* API simplification by reducing duplication removing deprecated endpoints.\r\n\r\nFor information on upgrading your existing TensorFlow 1.x models, please refer to our [Upgrade](https://medium.com/tensorflow/upgrading-your-code-to-tensorflow-2-0-f72c3a4d83b5) and [Migration](https://github.com/tensorflow/docs/blob/master/site/en/r2/guide/migration_guide.ipynb) guides.\r\nWe have also released a collection of [tutorials and getting started guides](https://github.com/tensorflow/docs/tree/master/site/en/r2), and an [Effective Style Guide for TF 2.0](https://github.com/tensorflow/docs/blob/master/site/en/r2/guide/effective_tf2.md).\r\n\r\nFor more information on these community-driven changes, be sure to check out the [RFCs](https://github.com/tensorflow/community/tree/master/rfcs) we have on Github. If you care about details, all of the RFCs are important.\r\nRefer to our [public project status tracker](https://github.com/orgs/tensorflow/projects/4) and [issues tagged with `2.0`](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A2.0) on GitHub for insight into recent issues and development progress.\r\n\r\nAnd, of course: we would love to have your feedback! If you experience any snags when using TF 2.0, be sure to let us know at the [TF 2.0 Testing User Group](https://groups.google.com/a/tensorflow.org/forum/?utm_medium=email&utm_source=footer#!forum/testing). We have a support mailing list as well as weekly testing meetings, and would love to hear your migration feedback and questions.\r\n\r\n### Some highlights:\r\n\r\n  * API clean-up, included removing `tf.app`, `tf.flags`, and `tf.logging` in favor of [absl-py](https://github.com/abseil/abseil-py).\r\n  * No more global variables with helper methods like `tf.global_variables_initializer` and `tf.get_global_step`.\r\n  * Functions, not sessions (`tf.Session` and `session.run` -> `tf.function`).\r\n  * Added support for TensorFlow Lite in TensorFlow 2.0.\r\n\r\n## Breaking Changes\r\n\r\n  * `tf.contrib` has been deprecated, and functionality has been either migrated to the core TensorFlow API, to [`tensorflow/addons`](https://www.github.com/tensorflow/addons), or removed entirely.\r\n  * Checkpoint breakage for [RNNs](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/26350) and for [Optimizers](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/26349).\r\n\r\n## Bug Fixes and Other Changes\r\n\r\n* `tf.estimator`\r\n  * Use `tf.compat.v1.estimator.inputs` instead of `tf.estimator.inputs` in Estimator.\r\n  * Replace contrib references with `tf.estimator.experimental.*` for apis in `early_stopping.py` in Estimator.\r\n* Keras & Python API\r\n  * Added top-k to precision and recall to keras metrics.\r\n  * Adding public APIs for `cumsum` and `cumprod` keras backend functions.\r\n  * Minor change to SavedModels exported from Keras using `tf.keras.experimental.export`. (SignatureDef key for evaluation mode is now \"eval\" instead of \"test\"). This will be reverted back to \"test\" in the near future.\r\n  * Add v2 module aliases for losses and metrics: `tf.losses = tf.keras.losses` & `tf.metrics = tf.keras.metrics`\r\n  * Add v2 module aliases for optimizers: `tf.optimizers = tf.keras.optimizers`\r\n  * `tf.keras.experimental.export` renamed to `tf.keras.experimental.export_saved_model`\r\n  * Add v2 module aliases for initializers: tf.initializers = tf.keras.initializers\r\n  * Add `tf.keras.layers.AbstractRNNCell` as the preferred implementation of RNN cell for TF v2. User can use it to implement RNN cell with custom behavior.\r\n  * Keras training and validation curves are shown on the same plot.\r\n  * Disable `run_eagerly` and distribution strategy if there are symbolic tensors added to the model using `add_metric` or `add_loss`.\r\n* Other:\r\n  * Only create a GCS directory object if the object does not already exist.\r\n  * Introduce `dynamic` constructor argument in Layer and Model, which should be set to True when using imperative control flow in the `call` method.\r\n  * `ResourceVariable` and `Variable` no longer accepts `constraint` in the constructor, nor expose it as a @property.\r\n  * `ResourceVariab...\r\n  * Add UnifiedGRU as the new GRU implementation for tf2.0. Change the default recurrent activation function for GRU from 'hard_sigmoid' to 'sigmoid', and 'reset_after' to True in 2.0. Historically recurrent activation is 'hard_sigmoid' since it is fast than 'sigmoid'. With new unified backend between CPU and GPU mode, since the CuDNN kernel is using sigmoid, we change the default for CPU mode to sigmoid as well. With that, the default GRU will be compatible with both CPU and GPU kernel. This will enable user with GPU to use CuDNN kernel by default and get a 10x performance boost in training. Note that this is checkpoint breaking change. If user want to use their 1.x pre-trained checkpoint, please construct the layer with GRU(recurrent_activation='hard_sigmoid', reset_after=False) to fallback to 1.x behavior.\r\n  * Begin adding Go wrapper for C Eager API\r\n  * XLA HLO graphs can be inspected with interactive_graphviz tool now.\r\n  * Add dataset ops to the graph (or create kernels in Eager execution) during the python Dataset object creation instead doing it during Iterator creation time.\r\n  * Add batch_dims argument to tf.gather.\r\n  * Removing of dtype in the constructor of initializers and partition_info in call.\r\n  * Add `tf.math.nextafter` op.\r\n  * Turn on MKL-DNN contraction kernels by default. MKL-DNN dynamically dispatches the best kernel implementation based on CPU vector architecture. To disable them, build with --define=tensorflow_mkldnn_contraction_kernel=0.\r\n  * Turn on MKL-DNN contraction kernels by default. MKL-DNN dynamically dispatches the best kernel implementation based on CPU vector architecture. To disable them, build with --define=tensorflow_mkldnn_contraction_kernel=0.\r\n  * Turn on MKL-DNN contraction kernels by default. MKL-DNN dynamically dispatches the best kernel implementation based on CPU vector architecture. To disable them, build with --define=tensorflow_mkldnn_contraction_kernel=0.\r\n  * `tf.linspace(start, stop, num)` now always uses \"stop\" as last value (for num > 1)\r\n  * Raw TensorFlow functions can now be used in conjunction with the Keras Functional API during model creation. This obviates the need for users to create Lambda layers in most cases when using the Functional API. Like Lambda layers, TensorFlow functions that result in Variable creation or assign ops are not supported.\r\n  * Add a ragged size op and register it to the op dispatcher\r\n  * Transitive dependencies on :pooling_ops were removed.  Some users may need to add explicit dependencies on :pooling_ops if they reference the operators from that library.\r\n  * Updates binary cross entropy logic in Keras when input is probabilities. Instead of converting probabilities to logits, we are using the cross entropy formula for probabilities.\r\n  * Add CompositeTensor base class.\r\n  * Malformed gif images could result in an access out of bounds in the color palette of the frame. This has been fixed now\r\n  * Add templates and interfaces for creating lookup tables\r\n  * `Tensor::UnsafeCopyFromInternal` deprecated in favor `Tensor::BitcastFrom`.\r\n  * In `map_vectorization` optimization, reduce the degree of parallelism in the vectorized map node.\r\n  * Add variant wrapper for `absl::string_view`.\r\n  * Post-training quantization tool supports quantizing weights shared by multiple operations. The models made with versions of this tool will use INT8 types for weights and will only be executable interpreters from this version onwards.\r\n  * Wraps losses passed to the `compile` API (strings and v1 losses) which are not instances of v2 `Loss` class in `LossWrapper` class. => All losses will now use `SUM_OVER_BATCH_SIZE` reduction as default.\r\n  * Add OpKernels for some stateless maps\r\n  * Add v2 APIs for AUCCurve and AUCSummationMethod enums.\r\n  * Add v2 APIs for AUCCurve and AUCSummationMethod enums.\r\n  * Allow non-Tensors through v2 losses.\r\n  * Add v2 sparse categorical crossentropy metric.\r\n  * `DType` is no longer convertible to an int. Use `dtype.as_datatype_enum` instead of `int(dtype)` to get the same result.\r\n  * Support both binary and -1/1 label input in v2 hinge and squared hinge losses.\r\n  * Bug fix: loss and gradients should now more reliably be correctly scaled w.r.t. the global batch size when using a tf.distribute.Strategy.\r\n  * Added LinearOperator.adjoint and LinearOperator.H (alias).\r\n  * Switching `tf.data functions` to use `defun`, providing an escape hatch to continue using the legacy `Defun`.\r\n  * Expose CriticalSection in core as `tf.CriticalSection`.\r\n  * Enhanced graphviz output.\r\n  * The behavior of `tf.gather` is now correct when axis=None and batch_dims<0.\r\n  * Add `tf.linalg.tridiagonal_solve` op.\r\n  * Add opkernel templates for common table operations.\r\n  * Fix callbacks do not log values in eager mode when a deferred build model is used.\r\n  * SignatureDef util functions have been deprecated.\r\n  * Update Fingerprint64Map to use aliases\r\n  * Add legacy string flat hash map op kernels\r\n  * Add support for passing list of lists to the `metrics` param in Keras `compile.\r\n  * Keras training and validation curves are shown on the same plot.\r\n  * Fix: `model.add_loss(symbolic_tensor)` should work in ambient eager.\r\n  * Adding `clear_losses` API to be able to clear losses at the end of forward pass in a custom training loop in eager.\r\n  * Add support for `add_metric` in the graph function mode.\r\n  * Adding `clear_losses` API to be able to clear losses at the end of forward pass in a custom training loop in eager.\r\n  * Updating cosine similarity loss - removed the negate sign from cosine similarity.\r\n  * TF 2.0 - Update metric name to always reflect what the user has given in compile. Affects following cases 1. When name is given as 'accuracy'/'crossentropy' 2. When an aliased function name is used eg. 'mse' 3. Removing the `weighted` prefix from weighted metric names.\r\n  * Workaround for compiler bug.\r\n  * Changed default for gradient accumulation for TPU embeddings to true.\r\n  * Adds summary trace API for collecting graph and profile information.\r\n  * Support for multi-host `ncclAllReduce` in Distribution Strategy.\r\n  * Enable `tf.distribute.experimental.MultiWorkerMirroredStrategy` working in eager mode.\r\n  * `image.resize` now considers proper pixel centers and has new kernels (incl. anti-aliasing).\r\n\r\n## Thanks to our Contributors\r\n\r\nThis release contains contributions from many people at Google, as well as:\r\n\r\n1e100, a6802739, Abolfazl Shahbazi, Adam Weiss, Ag Ramesh, Alan Du, Albin Joy, Amit, Amit Srivastava, Andy Craze, Anshuman Tripathy, Armen Poghosov, armenpoghosov, Arpit Shah, Ashwin Ramaswami, Aurelien Geron, AuréLien Geron, aweers, awesomealex1, Bairen Yi, Ben Barsdell, Bhavani Subramanian, Brandon Carter, candy.dc, Chao Liu, Clayne Robison, csukuangfj, Dan Jarvis, Dan Lazewatsky, Daniel Ingram, Dave Airlie, David Norman, Dayananda V, Denis Khalikov, Deven Desai, Dheeraj Rajaram Reddy, dmitrievanthony, Drew Szurko, Duncan Riach, Fei Hu, Felix Lemke, Filip Matzner, fo40225, frreiss, Gautam, gehring, Grzegorz George Pawelczak, Grzegorz Pawelczak, HanGuo97, Hari Shankar, hehongliang, Heungsub Lee, Hoeseong Kim, I-Hong Jhuo, Ilango R, Innovimax, Jacky Ko, Jakub Lipinski, Jason Zaman, jcf94, Jeff Poznanovic, Jia Qingtong, Jiankang, Joe Q, Joe Quadrino, Jonas Rauber, Jonathan Kyl, Joppe Geluykens, Joseph Friedman, jtressle, jwu, K.

    "body": "# Release 1.13.1\r\n\r\n## Major Features and Improvements\r\n\r\n* TensorFlow Lite has moved from contrib to core. This means that Python modules are under `tf.lite` and source code is now under `tensorflow/lite` rather than `tensorflow/contrib/lite`.\r\n* TensorFlow GPU binaries are now built against CUDA 10 and TensorRT 5.0.\r\n* Support for Python3.7 on all operating systems.\r\n* Moved NCCL to core.\r\n\r\n## Behavioral changes\r\n\r\n* Disallow conversion of python floating types to uint32/64 (matching behavior of other integer types) in `tf.constant`.\r\n* Make the `gain` argument of convolutional orthogonal initializers (`convolutional_delta_orthogonal`, `convolutional_orthogonal_1D`, `convolutional_orthogonal_2D`, `convolutional_orthogonal_3D`) have consistent behavior with the `tf.initializers.orthogonal` initializer, i.e. scale the output l2-norm by `gain` and NOT by `sqrt(gain)`. (Note that these functions are currently in `tf.contrib` which is not guaranteed backward compatible).\r\n\r\n## Bug Fixes and Other Changes\r\n\r\n* Documentation\r\n  * Update the doc with the details about the rounding mode used in quantize_and_dequantize_v2.\r\n  * Clarify that tensorflow::port::InitMain() _should_ be called before using the TensorFlow library.  Programs failing to do this are not portable to all platforms.\r\n* Deprecations and Symbol renames.\r\n   * Removing deprecations for the following endpoints: `tf.acos`, `tf.acosh`, `tf.add`, `tf.as_string`, `tf.asin`, `tf.asinh`, `tf.atan`, `tf.atan2`, `tf.atanh`, `tf.cos`, `tf.cosh`, `tf.equal`, `tf.exp`, `tf.floor`, `tf.greater`, `tf.greater_equal`, `tf.less`, `tf.less_equal`, `tf.log`, `tf.logp1`, `tf.logical_and`, `tf.logical_not`, `tf.logical_or`, `tf.maximum`, `tf.minimum`, `tf.not_equal`, `tf.sin`, `tf.sinh`, `tf.tan`\r\n  * Deprecate `tf.data.Dataset.shard`.\r\n  * Deprecate `saved_model.loader.load` which is replaced by `saved_model.load` and `saved_model.main_op`, which will be replaced by `saved_model.main_op` in V2.\r\n  * Deprecate tf.QUANTIZED_DTYPES. The official new symbol is tf.dtypes.QUANTIZED_DTYPES.\r\n  * Update sklearn imports for deprecated packages.\r\n  * Deprecate `Variable.count_up_to` and `tf.count_up_to` in favor of `Dataset.range`.\r\n  * Export `confusion_matrix` op as `tf.math.confusion_matrix` instead of `tf.train.confusion_matrix`.\r\n  * Add `tf.dtypes.` endpoint for every constant in dtypes.py; moving endpoints in versions.py to corresponding endpoints in `tf.sysconfig.` and `tf.version.`; moving all constants under `tf.saved_model` submodules to `tf.saved_model` module. New endpoints are added in V1 and V2 but existing endpoint removals are only applied in V2.\r\n  * Deprecates behavior where device assignment overrides collocation constraints inside a collocation context manager.\r\n* Keras & Python API\r\n  * Add to Keras functionality analogous to `tf.register_tensor_conversion_function`.\r\n  * Subclassed Keras models can now be saved through `tf.contrib.saved_model.save_keras_model`.\r\n  * `LinearOperator.matmul` now returns a new `LinearOperator`.\r\n* New ops and improved op functionality\r\n  * Add a Nearest Neighbor Resize op.\r\n  * Add an `ignore_unknown` argument to `parse_values` which suppresses ValueError for unknown hyperparameter types. Such * Add `tf.linalg.matvec` convenience function.\r\n  * `tf.einsum()`raises `ValueError` for unsupported equations like `\"ii->\"`.\r\n  * Add DCT-I and IDCT-I in `tf.signal.dct` and `tf.signal.idct`.\r\n  * Add LU decomposition op.\r\n  * Add quantile loss to gradient boosted trees in estimator.\r\n  * Add `round_mode` to `QuantizeAndDequantizeV2` op to select rounding algorithm.\r\n  * Add `unicode_encode`, `unicode_decode`, `unicode_decode_with_offsets`, `unicode_split`, `unicode_split_with_offset`, and `unicode_transcode` ops. Amongst other things, this Op adds the ability to encode, decode, and transcode a variety of input text encoding formats into the main Unicode encodings (UTF-8, UTF-16-BE, UTF-32-BE)\r\n  * Add \"unit\" attribute to the substr op, which allows obtaining the substring of a string containing unicode characters.\r\n  * Broadcasting support for Ragged Tensors.\r\n  * `SpaceToDepth` supports uint8 data type.\r\n  * Support multi-label quantile regression in estimator.\r\n  * We now use \"div\" as the default partition_strategy in `tf.nn.safe_embedding_lookup_sparse`, `tf.nn.sampled_softmax` and `tf.nn.nce_loss`.\r\n  hyperparameter are ignored.\r\n* Performance\r\n  * Improve performance of GPU cumsum/cumprod by up to 300x.\r\n  * Added support for weight decay in most TPU embedding optimizers, including AdamW and MomentumW.\r\n* TensorFlow 2.0 Development\r\n  * Add a command line tool to convert to TF2.0, tf_upgrade_v2\r\n  * Merge `tf.spectral` into `tf.signal` for TensorFlow 2.0.\r\n  * Change the default recurrent activation function for LSTM from 'hard_sigmoid' to 'sigmoid' in 2.0. Historically recurrent activation is 'hard_sigmoid' since it is fast than 'sigmoid'. With new unified backend between CPU and GPU mode, since the CuDNN kernel is using sigmoid, we change the default for CPU mode to sigmoid as well. With that, the default LSTM will be compatible with both CPU and GPU kernel. This will enable user with GPU to use CuDNN kernel by default and get a 10x performance boost in training. Note that this is checkpoint breaking change. If user want to use their 1.x pre-trained checkpoint, please construct the layer with LSTM(recurrent_activation='hard_sigmoid') to fallback to 1.x behavior.\r\n* TensorFlow Lite\r\n  * Move from `tensorflow/contrib/lite` to `tensorflow/lite`.\r\n  * Add experimental Java API for injecting TensorFlow Lite delegates\r\n  * Add support for strings in TensorFlow Lite Java API.\r\n* `tf.contrib`:\r\n  * Add Apache Ignite Filesystem plugin to support accessing Apache IGFS.\r\n  * Dropout now takes `rate` argument, `keep_prob` is deprecated.\r\n  * Estimator occurrences references `tf.contrib.estimator` were changed to `tf.estimator`:\r\n    * `tf.contrib.estimator.BaselineEstimator` with `tf.estimator.BaselineEstimator`\r\n    * `tf.contrib.estimator.DNNLinearCombinedEstimator` with `tf.estimator.DNNLinearCombinedEstimator`\r\n    * `tf.contrib.estimator.DNNEstimator` with `tf.estimator.DNNEstimator`\r\n    * `tf.contrib.estimator.LinearEstimator` with `tf.estimator.LinearEstimator`\r\n    * `tf.contrib.estimator.InMemoryEvaluatorHook` and tf.estimator.experimental.InMemoryEvaluatorHook`.\r\n    * `tf.contrib.estimator.make_stop_at_checkpoint_step_hook` with `tf.estimator.experimental.make_stop_at_checkpoint_step_hook`.\r\n  * Expose `tf.distribute.Strategy as the new name for tf.contrib.distribute.DistributionStrategy.\r\n  * Migrate linear optimizer from contrib to core.\r\n  * Move `tf.contrib.signal` to `tf.signal` (preserving aliases in tf.contrib.signal).\r\n  * Users of `tf.contrib.estimator.export_all_saved_models` and related should switch to `tf.estimator.Estimator.experimental_export_all_saved_models`.\r\n* tf.data:\r\n  * Add `tf.data.experimental.StatsOptions()`, to configure options to collect statistics from `tf.data.Dataset` pipeline using `StatsAggregator`. Add nested option, `experimental_stats` (which takes a `tf.data.experimen tal.StatsOptions` object), to `tf.data.Options`. Deprecates `tf.data.experimental.set_stats_agregator`.\r\n  * Performance optimizations:\r\n    * Add `tf.data.experimental.OptimizationOptions()`, to configure options to enable `tf.data` performance optimizations. Add nested option, `experimental_optimization` (which takes a `tf.data.experimental.OptimizationOptions` object), to `tf.data.Options`. Remove performance optimization options from `tf.data.Options`, and add them under `tf.data.experimental.OptimizationOptions` instead.\r\n    * Enable `map_and_batch_fusion` and `noop_elimination` optimizations by default. They can be disabled by configuring `tf.data.experimental.OptimizationOptions` to set `map_and_batch = False` or `noop_elimination = False` respectively.

    "body": "# Release 1.13.0 RC2\r\n\r\n## Major Features and Improvements\r\n\r\n* TensorFlow Lite has moved from contrib to core. This means that Python modules are under `tf.lite` and source code is now under `tensorflow/lite` rather than `tensorflow/contrib/lite`.\r\n* TensorFlow GPU binaries are now built against CUDA 10 and TensorRT 5.0.\r\n* Support for Python3.7 on all operating systems.\r\n* Moved NCCL to core.\r\n\r\n## Behavioral changes\r\n\r\n* Disallow conversion of python floating types to uint32/64 (matching behavior of other integer types) in `tf.constant`.\r\n* Make the `gain` argument of convolutional orthogonal initializers (`convolutional_delta_orthogonal`, `convolutional_orthogonal_1D`, `convolutional_orthogonal_2D`, `convolutional_orthogonal_3D`) have consistent behavior with the `tf.initializers.orthogonal` initializer, i.e. scale the output l2-norm by `gain` and NOT by `sqrt(gain)`. (Note that these functions are currently in `tf.contrib` which is not guaranteed backward compatible).\r\n\r\n## Bug Fixes and Other Changes\r\n\r\n* Documentation\r\n  * Update the doc with the details about the rounding mode used in quantize_and_dequantize_v2.\r\n  * Clarify that tensorflow::port::InitMain() _should_ be called before using the TensorFlow library.  Programs failing to do this are not portable to all platforms.\r\n* Deprecations and Symbol renames.\r\n   * Removing deprecations for the following endpoints: `tf.acos`, `tf.acosh`, `tf.add`, `tf.as_string`, `tf.asin`, `tf.asinh`, `tf.atan`, `tf.atan2`, `tf.atanh`, `tf.cos`, `tf.cosh`, `tf.equal`, `tf.exp`, `tf.floor`, `tf.greater`, `tf.greater_equal`, `tf.less`, `tf.less_equal`, `tf.log`, `tf.logp1`, `tf.logical_and`, `tf.logical_not`, `tf.logical_or`, `tf.maximum`, `tf.minimum`, `tf.not_equal`, `tf.sin`, `tf.sinh`, `tf.tan`\r\n  * Deprecate `tf.data.Dataset.shard`.\r\n  * Deprecate `saved_model.loader.load` which is replaced by `saved_model.load` and `saved_model.main_op`, which will be replaced by `saved_model.main_op` in V2.\r\n  * Deprecate tf.QUANTIZED_DTYPES. The official new symbol is tf.dtypes.QUANTIZED_DTYPES.\r\n  * Update sklearn imports for deprecated packages.\r\n  * Deprecate `Variable.count_up_to` and `tf.count_up_to` in favor of `Dataset.range`.\r\n  * Export `confusion_matrix` op as `tf.math.confusion_matrix` instead of `tf.train.confusion_matrix`.\r\n  * Add `tf.dtypes.` endpoint for every constant in dtypes.py; moving endpoints in versions.py to corresponding endpoints in `tf.sysconfig.` and `tf.version.`; moving all constants under `tf.saved_model` submodules to `tf.saved_model` module. New endpoints are added in V1 and V2 but existing endpoint removals are only applied in V2.\r\n  * Deprecates behavior where device assignment overrides collocation constraints inside a collocation context manager.\r\n* Keras & Python API\r\n  * Add to Keras functionality analogous to `tf.register_tensor_conversion_function`.\r\n  * Subclassed Keras models can now be saved through `tf.contrib.saved_model.save_keras_model`.\r\n  * `LinearOperator.matmul` now returns a new `LinearOperator`.\r\n* New ops and improved op functionality\r\n  * Add a Nearest Neighbor Resize op.\r\n  * Add an `ignore_unknown` argument to `parse_values` which suppresses ValueError for unknown hyperparameter types. Such * Add `tf.linalg.matvec` convenience function.\r\n  * `tf.einsum()`raises `ValueError` for unsupported equations like `\"ii->\"`.\r\n  * Add DCT-I and IDCT-I in `tf.signal.dct` and `tf.signal.idct`.\r\n  * Add LU decomposition op.\r\n  * Add quantile loss to gradient boosted trees in estimator.\r\n  * Add `round_mode` to `QuantizeAndDequantizeV2` op to select rounding algorithm.\r\n  * Add `unicode_encode`, `unicode_decode`, `unicode_decode_with_offsets`, `unicode_split`, `unicode_split_with_offset`, and `unicode_transcode` ops. Amongst other things, this Op adds the ability to encode, decode, and transcode a variety of input text encoding formats into the main Unicode encodings (UTF-8, UTF-16-BE, UTF-32-BE)\r\n  * Add \"unit\" attribute to the substr op, which allows obtaining the substring of a string containing unicode characters.\r\n  * Broadcasting support for Ragged Tensors.\r\n  * `SpaceToDepth` supports uint8 data type.\r\n  * Support multi-label quantile regression in estimator.\r\n  * We now use \"div\" as the default partition_strategy in `tf.nn.safe_embedding_lookup_sparse`, `tf.nn.sampled_softmax` and `tf.nn.nce_loss`.\r\n  hyperparameter are ignored.\r\n* Performance\r\n  * Improve performance of GPU cumsum/cumprod by up to 300x.\r\n  * Added support for weight decay in most TPU embedding optimizers, including AdamW and MomentumW.\r\n* TensorFlow 2.0 Development\r\n  * Add a command line tool to convert to TF2.0, tf_upgrade_v2\r\n  * Merge `tf.spectral` into `tf.signal` for TensorFlow 2.0.\r\n  * Change the default recurrent activation function for LSTM from 'hard_sigmoid' to 'sigmoid' in 2.0. Historically recurrent activation is 'hard_sigmoid' since it is fast than 'sigmoid'. With new unified backend between CPU and GPU mode, since the CuDNN kernel is using sigmoid, we change the default for CPU mode to sigmoid as well. With that, the default LSTM will be compatible with both CPU and GPU kernel. This will enable user with GPU to use CuDNN kernel by default and get a 10x performance boost in training. Note that this is checkpoint breaking change. If user want to use their 1.x pre-trained checkpoint, please construct the layer with LSTM(recurrent_activation='hard_sigmoid') to fallback to 1.x behavior.\r\n* TensorFlow Lite\r\n  * Move from `tensorflow/contrib/lite` to `tensorflow/lite`.\r\n  * Add experimental Java API for injecting TensorFlow Lite delegates\r\n  * Add support for strings in TensorFlow Lite Java API.\r\n* `tf.contrib`:\r\n  * Add Apache Ignite Filesystem plugin to support accessing Apache IGFS.\r\n  * Dropout now takes `rate` argument, `keep_prob` is deprecated.\r\n  * Estimator occurrences references `tf.contrib.estimator` were changed to `tf.estimator`:\r\n    * `tf.contrib.estimator.BaselineEstimator` with `tf.estimator.BaselineEstimator`\r\n    * `tf.contrib.estimator.DNNLinearCombinedEstimator` with `tf.estimator.DNNLinearCombinedEstimator`\r\n    * `tf.contrib.estimator.DNNEstimator` with `tf.estimator.DNNEstimator`\r\n    * `tf.contrib.estimator.LinearEstimator` with `tf.estimator.LinearEstimator`\r\n    * `tf.contrib.estimator.InMemoryEvaluatorHook` and tf.estimator.experimental.InMemoryEvaluatorHook`.\r\n    * `tf.contrib.estimator.make_stop_at_checkpoint_step_hook` with `tf.estimator.experimental.make_stop_at_checkpoint_step_hook`.\r\n  * Expose `tf.distribute.Strategy as the new name for tf.contrib.distribute.DistributionStrategy.\r\n  * Migrate linear optimizer from contrib to core.\r\n  * Move `tf.contrib.signal` to `tf.signal` (preserving aliases in tf.contrib.signal).\r\n  * Users of `tf.contrib.estimator.export_all_saved_models` and related should switch to `tf.estimator.Estimator.experimental_export_all_saved_models`.\r\n* tf.data:\r\n  * Add `tf.data.experimental.StatsOptions()`, to configure options to collect statistics from `tf.data.Dataset` pipeline using `StatsAggregator`. Add nested option, `experimental_stats` (which takes a `tf.data.experimen tal.StatsOptions` object), to `tf.data.Options`. Deprecates `tf.data.experimental.set_stats_agregator`.\r\n  * Performance optimizations:\r\n    * Add `tf.data.experimental.OptimizationOptions()`, to configure options to enable `tf.data` performance optimizations. Add nested option, `experimental_optimization` (which takes a `tf.data.experimental.OptimizationOptions` object), to `tf.data.Options`. Remove performance optimization options from `tf.data.Options`, and add them under `tf.data.experimental.OptimizationOptions` instead.\r\n    * Enable `map_and_batch_fusion` and `noop_elimination` optimizations by default. They can be disabled by configuring `tf.data.experimental.OptimizationOptions` to set `map_and_batch = False` or `noop_elimination = False` respectively. To disable all default optimizations, set `apply_default_optimizations = False`.\r\n    * Support parallel map in `map_and_filter_fusion`.\r\n    * Disable static optimizations for input pipelines that use non-resource `tf.Variable`s.\r\n  * Add NUMA-aware MapAndBatch dataset.\r\n  * Deprecate `tf.data.Dataset.make_one_shot_iterator()` in V1, removed it from V2, and added tf.compat.v1.data.make_one_shot_iterator()`.\r\n  * Deprecate `tf.data.Dataset.make_initializable_iterator()` in V1, removed it from V2, and added `tf.compat.v1.data.make_initializable_iterator()`.\r\n  * Enable nested dataset support in core `tf.data` transformations.\r\n  * For `tf.data.Dataset` implementers: Added `tf.data.Dataset._element_structured property` to replace `Dataset.output_{types,shapes,classes}`.\r\n  * Make `num_parallel_calls` of `tf.data.Dataset.interleave` and `tf.data.Dataset.map` work in Eager mode.\r\n* Toolchains\r\n  * Fixed OpenSSL compatibility by avoiding `EVP_MD_CTX_destroy`.\r\n  * Added bounds checking to printing deprecation warnings.\r\n  * Upgraded CUDA dependency to 10.0\r\n  * To build with Android NDK r14b, add \"#include <linux/compiler.h>\" to android-ndk-r14b/platforms/android-14/arch-*/usr/include/linux/futex.h\r\n  * Removed `:android_tensorflow_lib_selective_registration*` targets, use `:android_tensorflow_lib_lite*` targets instead.\r\n* XLA\r\n  * Move `RoundToEven` function to xla/client/lib/math.h.\r\n  * A new environment variable `TF_XLA_DEBUG_OPTIONS_PASSTHROUGH` set to \"1\" or \"true\" allows the debug options passed within an XRTCompile op to be passed directly to the XLA compilation backend. If such variable is not set (service side), only a restricted set will be passed through.\r\n  * Allow the XRTCompile op to return the ProgramShape resulted form the XLA compilation as a second return argument.\r\n  * XLA HLO graphs can now be rendered as SVG/HTML.\r\n* Estimator\r\n  * Replace all occurences of `tf.contrib.estimator.BaselineEstimator` with `tf.estimator.BaselineEstimator`\r\n  * Replace all occurences of `tf.contrib.estimator.DNNLinearCombinedEstimator` with `tf.estimator.DNNLinearCombinedEstimator`\r\n  * Replace all occurrences of `tf.contrib.estimator.DNNEstimator` with `tf.estimator.DNNEstimator`\r\n  * Replace all occurrences of `tf.contrib.estimator.LinearEstimator` with `tf.estimator.LinearEstimator`\r\n  * Users of `tf.contrib.estimator.export_all_saved_models` and related should switch to `tf.estimator.Estimator.experimental_export_all_saved_models`.\r\n  * Update `regression_head` to the new Head API for Canned Estimator V2.\r\n  * Switch `multi_class_head` to Head API for Canned Estimator V2.\r\n  * Replace all occurences of `tf.contrib.estimator.InMemoryEvaluatorHook` and `tf.contrib.estimator.make_stop_at_checkpoint_step_hook` with `tf.estimator.experimental.InMemoryEvaluatorHook` and `tf.estimator.experimental.make_stop_at_checkpoint_step_hook`\r\n  * Migrate linear optimizer from contrib to core.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Thanks to our Contributors\r\n\r\nThis release contains contributions from many people at Google, as well as:\r\n\r\nAbhinav Upadhyay, Ag Ramesh, akikaaa, Alexis Louis, Anders Huss, Andreas Madsen, Andrew Banchich, Andy Craze, Anton Dmitriev, Artem Malykh, Avijit-Nervana, Balint Cristian, Benjamin Tan Wei Hao, Bhavani Subramanian, Brendan Finan, Brian Nemsick, Bryan Cutler, By Shen, Cao Zongyan, Castiel, Chris Antaki, Christian Goll, Cibifang, Clayne Robison, Codrut Grosu, Cong Xu, Dalmo Cirne, Daniel Hunter, Dougal J.

With new unified backend between CPU and GPU mode, since the CuDNN kernel is using sigmoid, we change the default for CPU mode to sigmoid as well. With that, the default LSTM will be compatible with both CPU and GPU kernel. This will enable user with GPU to use CuDNN kernel by default and get a 10x performance boost in training. Note that this is checkpoint breaking change. If user want to use their 1.x pre-trained checkpoint, please construct the layer with LSTM(recurrent_activation='hard_sigmoid') to fallback to 1.x behavior.\r\n* TensorFlow Lite\r\n  * Move from `tensorflow/contrib/lite` to `tensorflow/lite`.\r\n  * Add experimental Java API for injecting TensorFlow Lite delegates\r\n  * Add support for strings in TensorFlow Lite Java API.\r\n* `tf.contrib`:\r\n  * Add Apache Ignite Filesystem plugin to support accessing Apache IGFS.\r\n  * Dropout now takes `rate` argument, `keep_prob` is deprecated.\r\n  * Estimator occurrences references `tf.contrib.estimator` were changed to `tf.estimator`:\r\n    * `tf.contrib.estimator.BaselineEstimator` with `tf.estimator.BaselineEstimator`\r\n    * `tf.contrib.estimator.DNNLinearCombinedEstimator` with `tf.estimator.DNNLinearCombinedEstimator`\r\n    * `tf.contrib.estimator.DNNEstimator` with `tf.estimator.DNNEstimator`\r\n    * `tf.contrib.estimator.LinearEstimator` with `tf.estimator.LinearEstimator`\r\n    * `tf.contrib.estimator.InMemoryEvaluatorHook` and tf.estimator.experimental.InMemoryEvaluatorHook`.\r\n    * `tf.contrib.estimator.make_stop_at_checkpoint_step_hook` with `tf.estimator.experimental.make_stop_at_checkpoint_step_hook`.\r\n  * Expose `tf.distribute.Strategy as the new name for tf.contrib.distribute.DistributionStrategy.\r\n  * Migrate linear optimizer from contrib to core.\r\n  * Move `tf.contrib.signal` to `tf.signal` (preserving aliases in tf.contrib.signal).\r\n  * Users of `tf.contrib.estimator.export_all_saved_models` and related should switch to `tf.estimator.Estimator.experimental_export_all_saved_models`.\r\n* tf.data:\r\n  * Add `tf.data.experimental.StatsOptions()`, to configure options to collect statistics from `tf.data.Dataset` pipeline using `StatsAggregator`. Add nested option, `experimental_stats` (which takes a `tf.data.experimen tal.StatsOptions` object), to `tf.data.Options`. Deprecates `tf.data.experimental.set_stats_agregator`.\r\n  * Performance optimizations:\r\n    * Add `tf.data.experimental.OptimizationOptions()`, to configure options to enable `tf.data` performance optimizations.

They can be disabled by configuring `tf.data.experimental.OptimizationOptions` to set `map_and_batch = False` or `noop_elimination = False` respectively. To disable all default optimizations, set `apply_default_optimizations = False`.\r\n    * Support parallel map in `map_and_filter_fusion`.\r\n    * Disable static optimizations for input pipelines that use non-resource `tf.Variable`s.\r\n  * Add NUMA-aware MapAndBatch dataset.\r\n  * Deprecate `tf.data.Dataset.make_one_shot_iterator()` in V1, removed it from V2, and added tf.compat.v1.data.make_one_shot_iterator()`.\r\n  * Deprecate `tf.data.Dataset.make_initializable_iterator()` in V1, removed it from V2, and added `tf.compat.v1.data.make_initializable_iterator()`.\r\n  * Enable nested dataset support in core `tf.data` transformations.\r\n  * For `tf.data.Dataset` implementers: Added `tf.data.Dataset._element_structured property` to replace `Dataset.output_{types,shapes,classes}`.\r\n* Toolchains\r\n  * Fixed OpenSSL compatibility by avoiding `EVP_MD_CTX_destroy`.\r\n  * Added bounds checking to printing deprecation warnings.\r\n  * Upgraded CUDA dependency to 10.0\r\n  * To build with Android NDK r14b, add \"#include <linux/compiler.h>\" to android-ndk-r14b/platforms/android-14/arch-*/usr/include/linux/futex.h\r\n  * Removed `:android_tensorflow_lib_selective_registration*` targets, use `:android_tensorflow_lib_lite*` targets instead.\r\n* XLA\r\n  * Move `RoundToEven` function to xla/client/lib/math.h.\r\n  * A new environment variable `TF_XLA_DEBUG_OPTIONS_PASSTHROUGH` set to \"1\" or \"true\" allows the debug options passed within an XRTCompile op to be passed directly to the XLA compilation backend. If such variable is not set (service side), only a restricted set will be passed through.\r\n  * Allow the XRTCompile op to return the ProgramShape resulted form the XLA compilation as a second return argument.\r\n  * XLA HLO graphs can now be rendered as SVG/HTML.\r\n* Estimator\r\n  * Replace all occurences of `tf.contrib.estimator.BaselineEstimator` with `tf.estimator.BaselineEstimator`\r\n  * Replace all occurences of `tf.contrib.estimator.DNNLinearCombinedEstimator` with `tf.estimator.DNNLinearCombinedEstimator`\r\n  * Replace all occurrences of `tf.contrib.estimator.DNNEstimator` with `tf.estimator.DNNEstimator`\r\n  * Replace all occurrences of `tf.contrib.estimator.LinearEstimator` with `tf.estimator.LinearEstimator`\r\n  * Users of `tf.contrib.estimator.export_all_saved_models` and related should switch to `tf.estimator.Estimator.experimental_export_all_saved_models`.\r\n  * Update `regression_head` to the new Head API for Canned Estimator V2.\r\n  * Switch `multi_class_head` to Head API for Canned Estimator V2.\r\n  * Replace all occurences of `tf.contrib.estimator.InMemoryEvaluatorHook` and `tf.contrib.estimator.make_stop_at_checkpoint_step_hook` with `tf.estimator.experimental.InMemoryEvaluatorHook` and `tf.estimator.experimental.make_stop_at_checkpoint_step_hook`\r\n  * Migrate linear optimizer from contrib to core.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Thanks to our Contributors\r\n\r\nThis release contains contributions from many people at Google, as well as:\r\n\r\nAbhinav Upadhyay, Ag Ramesh, akikaaa, Alexis Louis, Anders Huss, Andreas Madsen, Andrew Banchich, Andy Craze, Anton Dmitriev, Artem Malykh, Avijit-Nervana, Balint Cristian, Benjamin Tan Wei Hao, Bhavani Subramanian, Brendan Finan, Brian Nemsick, Bryan Cutler, By Shen, Cao Zongyan, Castiel, Chris Antaki, Christian Goll, Cibifang, Clayne Robison, Codrut Grosu, Cong Xu, Dalmo Cirne, Daniel Hunter, Dougal J.

    "body": "# Release 1.11.0\r\n\r\n## Major Features and Improvements\r\n\r\n* Nvidia GPU:\r\n  * Prebuilt binaries are now (as of TensorFlow 1.11) built against cuDNN 7.2 and TensorRT 4. See updated install guides: [Installing TensorFlow on Ubuntu](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/install_linux#tensorflow_gpu_support)\r\n* Google Cloud TPU:\r\n  * Experimental tf.data integration for Keras on Google Cloud TPUs.\r\n  * Experimental / preview support for eager execution on Google Cloud TPUs.\r\n* DistributionStrategy:\r\n  * Add multi-GPU DistributionStrategy support in tf.keras. Users can now use `fit`, `evaluate` and `predict` to distribute their model on multiple GPUs.\r\n  * Add multi-worker DistributionStrategy and standalone client support in Estimator. See [README] (https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tensorflow/contrib/distribute) for more details.\r\n* Add C, C++, and Python functions for querying kernels\r\n* Starting from this release, Windows builds will use Bazel. Therefore, we will drop official support for cmake.\r\n\r\n## Breaking Changes\r\n\r\n* Keras:\r\n  * The default values for tf.keras `RandomUniform`, `RandomNormal`, and `TruncatedNormal` initializers have been changed to match those in external Keras.\r\n  * Breaking change: `model.get_config()` on a Sequential model now returns a config dictionary (consistent with other Model instances) instead of a list of configs for the underlying layers.\r\n\r\n## Bug Fixes and Other Changes\r\n\r\n* C++:\r\n  * Changed the signature of SessionFactory::NewSession so that it can return a meaningful error message on failure.\r\n* tf.data:\r\n  * Remove `num_parallel_parser_calls` argument from `tf.contrib.data.make_csv_dataset()`. [tf.data] Remove `num_parallel_parser_calls` argument from `tf.contrib.data.make_csv_dataset()`.\r\n  * `tf.data.Dataset.list_files()` raises an exception at initialization time if the argument matches no files.\r\n  * Renamed BigTable class to BigtableTable for clarity\r\n  * Document use of the Cloud Bigtable API\r\n  * Adding `tf.contrib.data.reduce_dataset` which can be used to reduce a dataset to a single element.\r\n  * Generalization of `tf.contrib.data.sliding_window_batch`.\r\n* INC:\r\n  * Runtime improvements to triangular solve.\r\n* `tf.contrib`:\r\n  * Add an `implementation` argument to `tf.keras.layers.LocallyConnected2D` and `tf.keras.layers.LocallyConnected1D`. The new mode (`implementation=2`) performs forward pass as a single dense matrix multiplication, allowing dramatic speedups in certain scenarios (but worse performance in others - see docstring). The option also allows to use `padding=same`.\r\n  * Add documentation clarifying the differences between tf.fill and tf.constant.\r\n  * Add experimental IndexedDatasets.\r\n  * Add selective registration target using the lite proto runtime.\r\n  * Add simple Tensor and DataType classes to TensorFlow Lite Java\r\n  * Add support for bitcasting to/from uint32 and uint64.\r\n  * Added a subclass of Estimator that can be created from a SavedModel (SavedModelEstimator).\r\n  * Adds leaf index modes as an argument.\r\n  * Allow a different output shape from the input in tf.contrib.image.transform.\r\n  * Change the state_size order of the StackedRNNCell to be natural order. To keep the existing behavior, user can add reverse_state_order=True when constructing the StackedRNNCells.\r\n  * Deprecate self.test_session() in favor of self.session() or self.cached_session().\r\n  * Directly import tensor.proto.h (the transitive import will be removed from tensor.h soon)\r\n  * Estimator.train() now supports tf.contrib.summary.\\* summaries out of the box; each call to .train() will now create a separate tfevents file rather than re-using a shared one.\r\n  * Fix FTRL L2-shrinkage behavior: the gradient from the L2 shrinkage term should not end up in the accumulator.\r\n  * Fix toco compilation/execution on Windows\r\n  * GoogleZoneProvider class added to detect  which Google Cloud Engine zone tensorflow is running in.\r\n  * It is now safe to call any of the C API's TF_Delete\\* functions on nullptr\r\n  * Log some errors on Android to logcat\r\n  * Match FakeQuant numerics in TFLite to improve accuracy of TFLite quantized inference models.\r\n  * Optional bucket location check for the GCS Filesystem.\r\n  * Performance enhancements for StringSplitOp & StringSplitV2Op.\r\n  * Performance improvements for regex replace operations.\r\n  * TFRecordWriter now raises an error if .write() fails.\r\n  * TPU: More helpful error messages in TPUClusterResolvers.\r\n  * The legacy_init_op argument to SavedModelBuilder methods for adding MetaGraphs has been deprecated. Please use the equivalent main_op argument instead. As part of this, we now explicitly check for a single main_op or legacy_init_op at the time of SavedModel building, whereas the check on main_op was previously only done at load time.\r\n  * The protocol used for Estimator training is now configurable in RunConfig.\r\n  * Triangular solve performance improvements.\r\n  * Unify RNN cell interface between TF and Keras. Add new get_initial_state() to Keras and TF RNN cell, which will use to replace the existing zero_state() method.\r\n  * Update initialization of variables in Keras.\r\n  * Updates to \"constrained_optimization\" in tensorflow/contrib.\r\n  * boosted trees: adding pruning mode\r\n  * tf.train.Checkpoint does not delete old checkpoints by default.\r\n  * tfdbg: Limit the total disk space occupied by dumped tensor data to 100 GBytes. Add environment variable `TFDBG_DISK_BYTES_LIMIT` to allow adjustment of this upper limit.\r\n\r\n## Thanks to our Contributors\r\n\r\nThis release contains contributions from many people at Google, as well as:\r\n\r\nAapeli, adoda, Ag Ramesh, Amogh Mannekote, Andrew Gibiansky, Andy Craze, Anirudh Koul, Aurelien Geron, Avijit, Avijit-Nervana, Ben, Benjamin H.

See updated install guides: [Installing TensorFlow on Ubuntu](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/install_linux#tensorflow_gpu_support)\r\n* Google Cloud TPU:\r\n  * Experimental tf.data integration for Keras on Google Cloud TPUs.\r\n  * Experimental / preview support for eager execution on Google Cloud TPUs.\r\n* DistributionStrategy:\r\n  * Add multi-GPU DistributionStrategy support in tf.keras. Users can now use `fit`, `evaluate` and `predict` to distribute their model on multiple GPUs.\r\n  * Add multi-worker DistributionStrategy and standalone client support in Estimator. See [README] (https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tensorflow/contrib/distribute) for more details.\r\n* Add C, C++, and Python functions for querying kernels\r\n\r\n## Breaking Changes\r\n\r\n* Keras:\r\n  * The default values for tf.keras `RandomUniform`, `RandomNormal`, and `TruncatedNormal` initializers have been changed to match those in external Keras.\r\n  * Breaking change: `model.get_config()` on a Sequential model now returns a config dictionary (consistent with other Model instances) instead of a list of configs for the underlying layers.\r\n\r\n## Bug Fixes and Other Changes\r\n\r\n* C++:\r\n  * Changed the signature of SessionFactory::NewSession so that it can return a meaningful error message on failure.\r\n* tf.data:\r\n  * Remove `num_parallel_parser_calls` argument from `tf.contrib.data.make_csv_dataset()`.

The new mode (`implementation=2`) performs forward pass as a single dense matrix multiplication, allowing dramatic speedups in certain scenarios (but worse performance in others - see docstring). The option also allows to use `padding=same`.\r\n  * Add documentation clarifying the differences between tf.fill and tf.constant.\r\n  * Add experimental IndexedDatasets.\r\n  * Add selective registration target using the lite proto runtime.\r\n  * Add simple Tensor and DataType classes to TensorFlow Lite Java\r\n  * Add support for bitcasting to/from uint32 and uint64.\r\n  * Added a subclass of Estimator that can be created from a SavedModel (SavedModelEstimator).\r\n  * Adds leaf index modes as an argument.\r\n  * Allow a different output shape from the input in tf.contrib.image.transform.\r\n  * Change the state_size order of the StackedRNNCell to be natural order.

Please use the equivalent main_op argument instead. As part of this, we now explicitly check for a single main_op or legacy_init_op at the time of SavedModel building, whereas the check on main_op was previously only done at load time.\r\n  * The protocol used for Estimator training is now configurable in RunConfig.\r\n  * Triangular solve performance improvements.\r\n  * Unify RNN cell interface between TF and Keras.

Add new get_initial_state() to Keras and TF RNN cell, which will use to replace the existing zero_state() method.\r\n  * Update initialization of variables in Keras.\r\n  * Updates to \"constrained_optimization\" in tensorflow/contrib.\r\n  * boosted trees: adding pruning mode\r\n  * tf.train.Checkpoint does not delete old checkpoints by default.\r\n  * tfdbg: Limit the total disk space occupied by dumped tensor data to 100 GBytes. Add environment variable `TFDBG_DISK_BYTES_LIMIT` to allow adjustment of this upper limit.\r\n\r\n## Thanks to our Contributors\r\n\r\nThis release contains contributions from many people at Google, as well as:\r\n\r\nAapeli, adoda, Ag Ramesh, Amogh Mannekote, Andrew Gibiansky, Andy Craze, Anirudh Koul, Aurelien Geron, Avijit, Avijit-Nervana, Ben, Benjamin H.

These endpoints are going to be the preferred endpoints going forward and may replace some of the existing endpoints in the future. See below for the complete list.

Using the constructor directly is unsafe and deprecated.\r\n* Make the Bigtable client connection pool configurable & increase the default # of connections for performance.\r\n* Added derivative of `tf.random_gamma` with respect to the alpha parameter.\r\n* Added derivative of `tf.igamma(a, x)` and `tf.igammac(a, x)` with respect to a.\r\n* Modified Bessel functions of order zero and one.\r\n* Add FillTriangular Bijector to create triangular matrices.\r\n* Added support for Type III DCT, and `tf.spectral.idct(type=2|3)`.\r\n* Correctly handle CuDNN RNN weight loaded when nest in `TimeDistributed`.\r\n* Adding per-element weight support for `WALSComputePartialLhsAndRhsOp`.\r\n* ZerosLike and OnesLike ops treated as constants by Graph Transform Tool.\r\n* Gamma distribution and the derived distributions (Beta, Dirichlet, Student's t, inverse Gamma) now fully reparameterized.\r\n* Java: Experimental wrapper classes to make graph generation easier. Thanks @karllessard and @kbsriram\r\n* Build & link in secure gRPC components (switch from the insecure grpc dependency to secure grpc dependency).\r\n* Adding new endpoints for existing tensorflow symbols.

    "body": "# Release 1.10.0\r\n\r\n## Major Features And Improvements\r\n\r\n* The `tf.lite` runtime now supports `complex64`.\r\n* Initial Bigtable integration for `tf.data`.\r\n* Improved local run behavior in `tf.estimator.train_and_evaluate` which does not reload checkpoints for evaluation.\r\n* `RunConfig` now sets device_filters to restrict how workers and PS can communicate. This can speed up training and ensure clean shutdowns in some situations. But if you have jobs that require communication between workers, you will have to set custom session_options in your `RunConfig`.\r\n* Moved Distributions and Bijectors from `tf.contrib.distributions` to [Tensorflow Probability (TFP)](https://github.com/tensorflow/probability). `tf.contrib.distributions` is now deprecated and will be removed by the end of 2018.\r\n* Adding new endpoints for existing tensorflow symbols. These endpoints are going to be the preferred endpoints going forward and may replace some of the existing endpoints in the future. See below for the complete list. New symbols have been added to the following modules: [`tf.debugging`](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/master/api_docs/python/tf/debugging), [`tf.dtypes`](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/master/api_docs/python/tf/dtypes), [`tf.image`](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/master/api_docs/python/tf/image), [`tf.io`](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/master/api_docs/python/tf/io), [`tf.linalg`](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/master/api_docs/python/tf/linalg), [`tf.manip`](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/master/api_docs/python/tf/manip), [`tf.math`](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/master/api_docs/python/tf/math), [`tf.quantization`](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/master/api_docs/python/tf/quantization), [`tf.strings`](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/master/api_docs/python/tf/strings)\r\n\r\n## Breaking Changes\r\n\r\n* Prebuilt binaries are now (as of TensorFlow 1.10) built against NCCL 2.2 and no longer include NCCL in the binary install. TensorFlow usage with multiple GPUs and NCCL requires upgrade to [NCCL 2.2](https://developer.nvidia.com/nccl). See updated install guides: [Installing TensorFlow on Ubuntu](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/install_linux#tensorflow_gpu_support) and [Install TensorFlow from Sources](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/install_sources#optional_install_tensorflow_for_gpu_prerequisites).\r\n* Starting from TensorFlow 1.11, Windows builds will use Bazel. Therefore, we will drop official support for cmake.\r\n\r\n## Bug Fixes and Other Changes\r\n\r\n* `tf.data`:\r\n  * `tf.contrib.data.group_by_reducer()` is now available via the public API.\r\n  * `tf.contrib.data.choose_from_datasets()` is now available via the public API.\r\n  * Adding `drop_remainder` argument to `tf.data.Dataset.batch()` and `tf.data.Dataset.padded_batch()`, deprecating tf.contrib.data.batch_and_drop_remainder()` and `tf.contrib.data.padded_batch_and_drop_remainder()`.\r\n* `tf.estimator`:\r\n  * `Estimator`s now use custom savers included in `EstimatorSpec` scaffolds for saving SavedModels during export.\r\n  * `EstimatorSpec` will now add a default prediction output for export if no `export_output` is provided, eliminating the need to explicitly include a `PredictOutput` object in the `model_fn` for simple use-cases.\r\n  * Support sparse_combiner in canned Linear Estimators.\r\n  * Added batch normalization to `DNNClassifier`, `DNNRegressor`, and `DNNEstimator`.\r\n  * Adding ranking support for boosted trees.\r\n  * Adding center bias option for boosted trees.\r\n* Add `synchronization` and `aggregation` args to get_variable(). These args will be used for distributed variables.\r\n* Add `synchronization` and `aggregation` args to the layer `add_weight()` API. These args will be used for distributed variables.\r\n* `tf.losses.*` do not add to the global collection when executing eagerly (to avoid leaking memory).\r\n* Support different summary and checkpoint directories in `tf.train.MonitoredTrainingSession()`.\r\n* Added IndRNN, IndyGRU, and IndyLSTM cells to `tf.contrib.rnn`.\r\n* Add safe static factory functions for SparseTensor and convert all CHECKs to DCHECKs. Using the constructor directly is unsafe and deprecated.\r\n* Make the Bigtable client connection pool configurable & increase the default # of connections for performance.\r\n* Added derivative of `tf.random_gamma` with respect to the alpha parameter.\r\n* Added derivative of `tf.igamma(a, x)` and `tf.igammac(a, x)` with respect to a.\r\n* Modified Bessel functions of order zero and one.\r\n* Add FillTriangular Bijector to create triangular matrices.\r\n* Added support for Type III DCT, and `tf.spectral.idct(type=2|3)`.\r\n* Correctly handle CuDNN RNN weight loaded when nest in `TimeDistributed`.\r\n* Adding per-element weight support for `WALSComputePartialLhsAndRhsOp`.\r\n* ZerosLike and OnesLike ops treated as constants by Graph Transform Tool.\r\n* Gamma distribution and the derived distributions (Beta, Dirichlet, Student's t, inverse Gamma) now fully reparameterized.\r\n* Java: Experimental wrapper classes to make graph generation easier. Thanks @karllessard and @kbsriram\r\n* Build & link in secure gRPC components (switch from the insecure grpc dependency to secure grpc dependency).\r\n* Adding new endpoints for existing tensorflow symbols.

List of new endpoints:\r\n  * New endpoints in `tf.image` namespace: `tf.image.extract_image_patches`\r\n  * New endpoints in `tf.debugging` namespace: `tf.debugging.check_numerics`, `tf.debugging.is_finite`, `tf.debugging.is_inf`, `tf.debugging.is_nan`.\r\n  * New endpoints in `tf.dtypes` namespace: `tf.dtypes.as_string`.\r\n  * New endpoints in `tf.io` namespace: `tf.io.decode_base64`, `tf.io.decode_compressed`, `tf.io.decode_json_example`, `tf.io.decode_raw`, `tf.io.encode_base64`, `tf.io.matching_files`, `tf.io.parse_tensor`, `tf.io.read_file, `tf.io.write_file`.\r\n  * New endpoints in tf.linalg namespace: `tf.linalg.cross`, `tf.linalg.tensor_diag` (corresponds to `tf.diag`), `tf.linalg.tensor_diag_part` (corresponds to `tf.diag_part`).\r\n  * New endpoints in tf.manip namespace: `tf.manip.batch_to_space_nd`, `tf.manip.gather_nd`, `tf.manip.reshape`, `tf.manip.reverse`, `tf.manip.scatter_nd`, `tf.manip.space_to_batch_nd`, `tf.manip.tile`\r\n  * New endpoints in tf.math namespace: `tf.math.acos`, `tf.math.acosh`, `tf.math.add`, `tf.math.asin`, `tf.math.asinh`, `tf.math.atan`, `tf.math.atan2`, `tf.math.atanh`, `tf.math.betainc`, `tf.math.ceil`, `tf.math.cos`, `tf.math.cosh`, `tf.math.digamma`, `tf.math.equal`, `tf.math.erfc`, `tf.math.exp`, `tf.math.expm1`, `tf.math.floor`, `tf.math.greater`, `tf.math.greater_equal`, `tf.math.igamma`, `tf.math.igammac`, `tf.math.invert_permutation`, `tf.math.less`, `tf.math.less_equal`, `tf.math.lgamma`, `tf.math.log`, `tf.math.log1p`, `tf.math.logical_and`, `tf.math.logical_not`, `tf.math.logical_or`, `tf.math.maximum`, `tf.math.minimum`, `tf.math.not_equal`, `tf.math.polygamma`, `tf.math.reciprocal`, `tf.math.rint`, `tf.math.rsqrt`, `tf.math.segment_max`, `tf.math.segment_mean`, `tf.math.segment_min`, `tf.math.segment_prod`, `tf.math.segment_sum`, `tf.math.sin`, `tf.math.sinh`, `tf.math.softplus`, `tf.math.softsign`, `tf.math.squared_difference`, `tf.math.tan`, `tf.math.unsorted_segment_max`, `tf.math.unsorted_segment_min`, `tf.math.unsorted_segment_prod`, `tf.math.unsorted_segment_sum`, `tf.math.zeta`.\r\n  * New endpoints in `tf.quantization` namespace: `tf.quantization.dequantize`, `tf.quantization.fake_quant_with_min_max_args`, `tf.quantization.fake_quant_with_min_max_args_gradient`, `tf.quantization.fake_quant_with_min_max_vars`,  `tf.quantization.fake_quant_with_min_max_vars_gradient`, `tf.quantization.fake_quant_with_min_max_vars_per_channel`,  `tf.quantization.fake_quant_with_min_max_vars_per_channel_gradient`.\r\n  * New endpoints in tf.strings namespace: `tf.strings.join` (corresponds to `tf.string_join`), `tf.strings.regex_replace`, `tf.strings.to_number` (corresponds to `tf.string_to_number`), `tf.strings.strip` (corresponds to `tf.string_strip`), `tf.strings.substr`, `tf.strings.to_hash_bucket` (corresponds to `tf.string_to_hash_bucket`), `tf.strings.to_hash_bucket_fast` (corresponds to `tf.string_to_hash_bucket_fast`), `tf.strings.to_hash_bucket_strong` (corresponds to `tf.string_to_hash_bucket_strong`).\r\n\r\n\r\n## Thanks to our Contributors\r\n\r\nThis release contains contributions from many people at Google, as well as:\r\n\r\nAg Ramesh, Alex Wiltschko, Alexander Pantyukhin, Amogh Mannekote, An Jiaoyang, Andrei Nigmatulin, Andrew Ginns, BjøRn Moholt, Brett Koonce, Chengzhi Chen, Chinmay Das, Christian Ertler, Christoph Boeddeker, Clayne Robison, Courtial Florian, ctiijima, Dan Douthit, Dan J, Dan Ringwalt, EFanZh, Emanuele Ballarin, eqy, Evgeniy Zheltonozhskiy, Freedom\" Koan-Sin Tan, FréDéRic Branchaud-Charron, G K, gracehoney, Guillaume Klein, Guozhong Zhuang, Hsien-Yang Li, hsm207, ImSheridan, Jayaram Bobba, Jiandong Ruan, Jie, Joel Shor, Jonas Rauber, Jongmin Baek, jsawruk, Karan Kaw, Karl Lessard, karl@kubx.ca, Kb Sriram, KinmanLam, leiiwang, Li, Yiqiang, Loo Rong Jie, Mahmoud Abuzaina, Mahmoud Aslan, ManHyuk, Martin Patz, Martin Zeitler, mktozk, Mohammad Ashraf Bhuiyan, mrTsjolder, Naman Bhalla, Nick Felt, Nicolas Lopez, Niranjan Hasabnis, Nishidha Panpaliya, Nitish, nrstott, Nutti, Parag Jain, PeterLee, Philipp Jund, Rach L, Rafal Wojdyla, Roland Zimmermann, Sergei Lebedev, SneakyFish5, Soila Kavulya, Sriram Veturi, Steven Schmatz, Taehoon Lee, Tang, Wenyi, Taras Sereda, Ted Chang, Tim Zaman, Tristan Rice, tucan, vchigrin, Vikram Tiwari, Vincent, WeberXie, William D.

This will correspond to an attribute name with an embedded '.' symbol (e.g. 'a.b'), which can only be accessed indirectly (e.g. through getattr and setattr).  To set this up the user will first need to explicitly add the variable to the hparam object (e.g. \"hparams.add_hparam(name='a.b', value=0.0)\").\r\n  * Benchmark for tf.scan in graph and eager modes.\r\n  * Added complex128 support to FFT, FFT2D, FFT3D, IFFT, IFFT2D, and IFFT3D.\r\n  * Making ids unique in `nn.embedding_lookup_sparse`.

    "body": "# Release 1.9.0\r\n\r\n## Major Features And Improvements\r\n* Update tf.keras to the Keras 2.1.6 API.\r\n* `tfe.Network` is deprecated. Please inherit from `tf.keras.Model`.\r\n* Adding support of core feature columns and losses to gradient boosted trees estimators.\r\n* The distributions.Bijector API supports broadcasting for Bijectors with new API changes. See [here](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r1.9/api_docs/python/tf/distributions/bijectors/Bijector) for more details.\r\n* Layered variable names have changed in the following conditions:\r\n  * Using `tf.keras.layers` with custom variable scopes.\r\n  * Using `tf.layers` in  a subclassed `tf.keras.Model` class. See [here](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r1.9/api_docs/python/tf/layers) for more details\r\n\r\n## Breaking Chances\r\n  * If you're opening empty variable scopes; replace `variable_scope`('', ...) by `variable_scope`(`tf.get_variable_scope()`, ...).\r\n\r\n## Bug Fixes and Other Changes\r\n* `tf.data`:\r\n  * The `DatasetBase::DebugString()` method is now `const`.\r\n  * Added the `tf.contrib.data.sample_from_datasets()` API for randomly sampling from multiple datasets.\r\n* Eager Execution:\r\n* `tf.keras`:\r\n  * Move Keras code out of _impl folder and remove API files.\r\n  * `tf.keras.Model.save_weights` now saves in TensorFlow format by default.\r\n  * Enable dataset iterators to be passed to `tf.keras.Model` training/eval methods.\r\n* Accelerated Linear Algebra (XLA):\r\n* TensorFlow Debugger (tfdbg) CLI:\r\n* `tf.contrib`:\r\n  * Add `tf.contrib.data.choose_from_datasets()`.\r\n  * `tf.contrib.data.make_csv_dataset()` now supports line breaks in quoted strings. Two arguments were removed from `make_csv_dataset`.\r\n  * `tf.contrib.framework.zero_initializer` supports ResourceVariable.\r\n  * Adding \"constrained_optimization\" to tensorflow/contrib.\r\n* Other:\r\n  * Add GCS Configuration Ops.\r\n  * Changing signature of `MakeIterator` to enable propagating error status.\r\n  * KL divergence for two Dirichlet distributions.\r\n  * More consistent GcsFileSystem behavior for certain reads past EOF.\r\n  * Update benchmark for tf.scan to match ranges across eager and graph modes.\r\n  * Fixed bug in `tf.reduce_prod gradient` for complex dtypes.\r\n  * Add optional `args` argument to `Dataset.from_generator()`.\r\n  * Allow the use of '.' in variables (e.g. \"hparams.parse('a.b=1.0')\"), which would previously raise an error. This will correspond to an attribute name with an embedded '.' symbol (e.g. 'a.b'), which can only be accessed indirectly (e.g. through getattr and setattr).  To set this up the user will first need to explicitly add the variable to the hparam object (e.g. \"hparams.add_hparam(name='a.b', value=0.0)\").\r\n  * Benchmark for tf.scan in graph and eager modes.\r\n  * Added complex128 support to FFT, FFT2D, FFT3D, IFFT, IFFT2D, and IFFT3D.\r\n  * Making ids unique in `nn.embedding_lookup_sparse`. This helps to reduce RPC calls for looking up the embeddings when there are repeated ids in the batch.\r\n  * Support indicator column in boosted trees.\r\n  * Prevent `tf.gradients()` from backpropagating through integer tensors.\r\n  * LinearOperator[1D,2D,3D]Circulant added to `tensorflow.linalg`.\r\n  * Conv3D, Conv3DBackpropInput, Conv3DBackpropFilter now supports arbitrary.\r\n  * Added `tf.train.Checkpoint` for reading/writing object-based checkpoints.\r\n  * `Dataset.list_files()` now produces determinstic results when `shuffle=False` or a `seed` is passed.\r\n  * Added LinearOperatorKronecker, a dense-free implementation of the Kronecker Product.\r\n  * Allow LinearOperator to broadcast.\r\n  * SavedModelBuilder will now deduplicate asset names that point to files with the same basename and the same contents. Note that this may result in new asset files included in SavedModels in cases where assets with the same name but different contents were previously overwriting each other.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Thanks to our Contributors\r\n\r\nThis release contains contributions from many people at Google, as well as:\r\n\r\nAbdullah Alrasheed, Achal Shah, Ad-530, ADiegoCAlonso, Aditya Yogi, Ag Ramesh, akindyakov, Andy Kernahan, Anya Petrova, Aurelien Geron, Ben, Ben Barsdell, Bhavani-Subramanian, braincodercn, Brett Koonce, Brian Nemsick, Brian Zier, Bryan Heden, candy.dc, cclauss, Clayne Robison, ctiijima, Dalmo Cirne, David Norman, David T.H.

Subsequent code using n as index may cause an out-of-bounds read.\r\n  * TensorFlow checkpoint meta file uses Google's [https://github.com/google/snappy](snappy) compression/decompression library.

Both `Dataset.__iter__()` and `Dataset.make_one_shot_iterator()` can now be used to create iterators when eager execution is enabled.\r\n  * Automatic device placement has been enabled (i.e., use a GPU if available automatically, without requiring an explicit `with tf.device(“/gpu:0”)`) (Fixes #14133)\r\n  * `tf.GradientTape` has moved out of contrib.\r\n* `tf.keras`:\r\n  * Added the fashion mnist dataset.\r\n  * New data preprocessing functions: `image/random_brightness`, `sequence/TimeseriesGenerator`, and `text/hashing_trick`.\r\n* Accelerated Linear Algebra (XLA):\r\n  * Select and scatter in reference util and evaluator now use lexicographical order to break ties.\r\n* TensorFlow Debugger (tfdbg) CLI:\r\n  * During tensor-filter operations, allow exclusion of nodes by regular expressions.\r\n  * Fix spurious background colors in some text terminals.\r\n* `tf.contrib`:\r\n  * Add meta-distribution BatchReshape which reshapes batch dimensions.\r\n  * `tf.contrib.layers.recompute_grad` works for explicit gradient checkpointing on TPU.\r\n  * Add `tf.contrib.framework.argsort`.\r\n  * Allow `DNNBoostedTreeCombinedEstimator` to work with core versions of feature columns and losses.\r\n  * Add non-linear image warping ops: `tf.contrib.image.sparse_image_warp`, `tf.contrib.image.dense_image_warp`, and `tf.contrib.image.interpolate_spline`.\r\n  * Fix bug in `tf.contrib.opt.MultitaskOptimizerWrapper` where types of tensors were mismatched.\r\n* Other:\r\n  * Low-level graph construction now calls the TensorFlow C API. This change should be invisible to most users, but can be disabled by setting the environment variable `TF_C_API_GRAPH_CONSTRUCTION=0` in this release. Future releases will remove the ability to disable this change. Please [file a bug](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/new) if you find yourself using this escape hatch.\r\n  * Add description of shapes and a pointer to tutorial notebook in `tf.distributions.Distribution`.\r\n  * Update scatter operations:\r\n    * Add `tf.scatter_min` and `tf.scatter_max`\r\n    * Extend scatter operations to work with a scalar update parameter.\r\n  * Move cuDNN RNN ops to core for use in TensorFlow codebase only.\r\n  * Add `float64` support for `Conv2d`, `Conv2dBackpropInput`, and `Conv2dBackpropFilter`.\r\n  * Add `float64` support for `AvgPool`/`AvgPoolGrad`.\r\n  * Make graph name scope thread local so that they work correctly in multi-threaded environments.\r\n  * Update nsync synchronization library to avoid slow primitives on Linux.\r\n  * Removed need to put nsync/public on C include path when building custom ops.\r\n  * Add `tf.image.psnr`, `tf.image.ssim`, `tf.image.ssim_multiscale`, `tf.image.image_gradients`, `tf.image.sobel_edges`.\r\n  * Add links to https://js.tensorflow.org.\r\n  * Fix non-uniformity of orthogonal matrices.\r\n  * Fix bug where multi-image Estimator eval summaries were not displayed correctly.\r\n\r\n<a name=\"rpc-issue\"><sup>1</sup></a> The cancellation logic of the RPC op contains a concurrency error. A fix has been submitted to master and will be part of the next release.\r\n\r\n## Thanks to our Contributors\r\n\r\nThis release contains contributions from many people at Google, as well as:\r\n\r\n4d55397500, Aghasy, Alan Du, Alan Lee, Alan Yee, Alex Wiltschko, Animesh Karnewar, Ankit Gupta, Anton Matosov, Aris L, Ben Barsdell, Brent Yi, Brett Koonce, Carl Thomé, cbockman, Chikanaga Tomoyuki, Chris Tava, CéDric Deltheil, Dahan Gong, Dalmo Cirne, Daniel Erenrich, David Norman, DavidNorman, Edd Wilder-James, Fanjin Zeng, Felix Abecassis, fo40225, George Sterpu, Giovanni Terlingen, Gor Baghdasaryan, Guillaume Klein, Hanchen Li, Ilya Polenov, Jakub Kolodziejczyk, Jason Sadler, Jayaram Bobba, Jerry Liu, jinghuangintel, Jiongyan Zhang (张炯衍), Joel Shor, Jong Wook Kim, Julian Eisenschlos, Karl Lessard, Krish Ravindranath, Loo Rong Jie, Lukas Geiger, Luke Iwanski, Mahmoud Abuzaina, ManHyuk, Marvin Richter, Maximilian Mitchell, Mohammad Ashraf Bhuiyan, msofka, Mustafa Kasap, Nathan Burnham, Nathan Luehr, Naveen Marri, ngc92, nio1814, Oleg Zabluda, Ou Changkun, Panos Ipeirotis, Paul Van Eck, Peter Lee, Piotr Czapla, qjivy, Rholais Lii, Rodrigo Formigone, Russell Klopfer, ryantimjohn, Sang Han, SebastiáN RamíRez, shengfuintel, Siby Jose Plathottam, Silver Chan, Stanislaw Antol, Taehoon Lee, Tarang Chugh, Ted Chang, Thomas Bastiani, Xian Xu, Xiaoming (Jason) Cui, Yan Facai (颜发才), yaox12, Yashal Shakti Kanungo, Yong Tang, Yuan (Terry) Tang, Yuxin Wu, Ziyue(Louis) Lu\r\n"

Both `Dataset.__iter__()` and `Dataset.make_one_shot_iterator()` can now be used to create iterators when eager execution is enabled.\r\n  * Automatic device placement has been enabled (i.e., use a GPU if available automatically, without requiring an explicit `with tf.device(“/gpu:0”)`) (Fixes #14133)\r\n  * `tf.GradientTape` has moved out of contrib.\r\n* `tf.keras`:\r\n  * Added the fashion mnist dataset.\r\n  * New data preprocessing functions: `image/random_brightness`, `sequence/TimeseriesGenerator`, and `text/hashing_trick`.\r\n* Accelerated Linear Algebra (XLA):\r\n  * Select and scatter in reference util and evaluator now use lexicographical order to break ties.\r\n* TensorFlow Debugger (tfdbg) CLI:\r\n  * During tensor-filter operations, allow exclusion of nodes by regular expressions.\r\n  * Fix spurious background colors in some text terminals.\r\n* `tf.contrib`:\r\n  * Add meta-distribution BatchReshape which reshapes batch dimensions.\r\n  * `tf.contrib.layers.recompute_grad` works for explicit gradient checkpointing on TPU.\r\n  * Add `tf.contrib.framework.argsort`.\r\n  * Allow `DNNBoostedTreeCombinedEstimator` to work with core versions of feature columns and losses.\r\n  * Add non-linear image warping ops: `tf.contrib.image.sparse_image_warp`, `tf.contrib.image.dense_image_warp`, and `tf.contrib.image.interpolate_spline`.\r\n  * Fix bug in `tf.contrib.opt.MultitaskOptimizerWrapper` where types of tensors were mismatched.\r\n* Other:\r\n  * Low-level graph construction now calls the TensorFlow C API. This change should be invisible to most users, but can be disabled by setting the environment variable `TF_C_API_GRAPH_CONSTRUCTION=0` in this release. Future releases will remove the ability to disable this change. Please [file a bug](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/new) if you find yourself using this escape hatch.\r\n  * Add description of shapes and a pointer to tutorial notebook in `tf.distributions.Distribution`.\r\n  * Update scatter operations:\r\n    * Add `tf.scatter_min` and `tf.scatter_max`\r\n    * Extend scatter operations to work with a scalar update parameter.\r\n  * Move cuDNN RNN ops to core for use in TensorFlow codebase only.\r\n  * Add `float64` support for `Conv2d`, `Conv2dBackpropInput`, and `Conv2dBackpropFilter`.\r\n  * Add `float64` support for `AvgPool`/`AvgPoolGrad`.\r\n  * Make graph name scope thread local so that they work correctly in multi-threaded environments.\r\n  * Update nsync synchronization library to avoid slow primitives on Linux.\r\n  * Removed need to put nsync/public on C include path when building custom ops.\r\n  * Add `tf.image.psnr`, `tf.image.ssim`, `tf.image.ssim_multiscale`, `tf.image.image_gradients`, `tf.image.sobel_edges`.\r\n  * Add links to https://js.tensorflow.org.\r\n  * Fix non-uniformity of orthogonal matrices.\r\n  * Fix bug where multi-image Estimator eval summaries were not displayed correctly.\r\n\r\n## Thanks to our Contributors\r\n\r\nThis release contains contributions from many people at Google, as well as:\r\n\r\n4d55397500, Aghasy, Alan Du, Alan Lee, Alan Yee, Alex Wiltschko, Animesh Karnewar, Ankit Gupta, Anton Matosov, Aris L, Ben Barsdell, Brent Yi, Brett Koonce, Carl Thomé, cbockman, Chikanaga Tomoyuki, Chris Tava, CéDric Deltheil, Dahan Gong, Dalmo Cirne, Daniel Erenrich, David Norman, DavidNorman, Edd Wilder-James, Fanjin Zeng, Felix Abecassis, fo40225, George Sterpu, Giovanni Terlingen, Gor Baghdasaryan, Guillaume Klein, Hanchen Li, Ilya Polenov, Jakub Kolodziejczyk, Jason Sadler, Jayaram Bobba, Jerry Liu, jinghuangintel, Jiongyan Zhang (张炯衍), Joel Shor, Jong Wook Kim, Julian Eisenschlos, Karl Lessard, Krish Ravindranath, Loo Rong Jie, Lukas Geiger, Luke Iwanski, Mahmoud Abuzaina, ManHyuk, Marvin Richter, Maximilian Mitchell, Mohammad Ashraf Bhuiyan, msofka, Mustafa Kasap, Nathan Burnham, Nathan Luehr, Naveen Marri, ngc92, nio1814, Oleg Zabluda, Ou Changkun, Panos Ipeirotis, Paul Van Eck, Peter Lee, Piotr Czapla, qjivy, Rholais Lii, Rodrigo Formigone, Russell Klopfer, ryantimjohn, Sang Han, SebastiáN RamíRez, shengfuintel, Siby Jose Plathottam, Silver Chan, Stanislaw Antol, Taehoon Lee, Tarang Chugh, Ted Chang, Thomas Bastiani, Xian Xu, Xiaoming (Jason) Cui, Yan Facai (颜发才), yaox12, Yashal Shakti Kanungo, Yong Tang, Yuan (Terry) Tang, Yuxin Wu, Ziyue(Louis) Lu"

This may break TF on older CPUs.\r\n\r\n## Major Features And Improvements\r\n* New Optimizer internal API for non-slot variables. Descendants of AdamOptimizer that access _beta[12]_power will need to be updated.\r\n* `tf.estimator.{FinalExporter,LatestExporter}` now export stripped SavedModels. This improves forward compatibility of the SavedModel.\r\n* FFT support added to XLA CPU/GPU.\r\n* Android TF can now be built with CUDA acceleration on compatible Tegra devices (see [contrib/makefile/README.md](contrib/makefile/README.md) for more information)\r\n\r\n## Bug Fixes and Other Changes\r\n* Documentation updates:\r\n  * Added a second version of Getting Started, which is aimed at ML\r\nnewcomers.\r\n  * Clarified documentation on `resize_images.align_corners` parameter.\r\n  * Additional documentation for TPUs.\r\n* Google Cloud Storage (GCS):\r\n  * Add client-side throttle.\r\n  * Add a `FlushCaches()` method to the FileSystem interface, with an implementation for GcsFileSystem.\r\n* Other:\r\n  * Add `tf.contrib.distributions.Kumaraswamy`.\r\n  * `RetryingFileSystem::FlushCaches()` calls the base FileSystem's `FlushCaches()`.\r\n  * Add auto_correlation to distributions.\r\n  * Add `tf.contrib.distributions.Autoregressive`.\r\n  * Add SeparableConv1D layer.\r\n  * Add convolutional Flipout layers.\r\n  * When both inputs of `tf.matmul` are bfloat16, it returns bfloat16, instead of float32.\r\n  * Added `tf.contrib.image.connected_components`.\r\n  * Add `tf.contrib.framework.CriticalSection` that allows atomic variable access.\r\n  * Output variance over trees predictions for classifications tasks.\r\n  * For `pt` and `eval` commands, allow writing tensor values to filesystem as numpy files.\r\n  * gRPC: Propagate truncated errors (instead of returning gRPC internal error).\r\n  * Augment parallel_interleave to support 2 kinds of prefetching.\r\n  * Improved XLA support for C64-related ops log, pow, atan2, tanh.\r\n  * Add probabilistic convolutional layers.\r\n\r\n## API Changes\r\n* Introducing prepare_variance boolean with default setting to False for backward compatibility.\r\n* Move `layers_dense_variational_impl.py` to `layers_dense_variational.py`.\r\n\r\n## Known Bugs\r\n* Using XLA:GPU with CUDA 9 and CUDA 9.1 results in garbage results and/or\r\n  `CUDA_ILLEGAL_ADDRESS` failures.\r\n\r\n  Google discovered in mid-December 2017 that the PTX-to-SASS compiler in CUDA 9\r\n  and CUDA 9.1 sometimes does not properly compute the carry bit when\r\n  decomposing 64-bit address calculations with large offsets (e.g. `load [x +\r\n  large_constant]`) into 32-bit arithmetic in SASS.\r\n\r\n  As a result, these versions of `ptxas` miscompile most XLA programs which use\r\n  more than 4GB of temp memory.  This results in garbage results and/or\r\n  `CUDA_ERROR_ILLEGAL_ADDRESS` failures.\r\n\r\n  A fix in CUDA 9.1.121 is expected in late February 2018.  We do not expect a\r\n  fix for CUDA 9.0.x.  Until the fix is available, the only workaround is to\r\n  [downgrade](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit-archive) to CUDA 8.0.x\r\n  or disable XLA:GPU.\r\n\r\n  TensorFlow will print a warning if you use XLA:GPU with a known-bad version of\r\n  CUDA; see e00ba24c4038e7644da417ddc639169b6ea59122.\r\n* The `tensorboard` command or module may appear to be missing after certain\r\n  upgrade flows. This is due to pip package conflicts as a result of changing\r\n  the TensorBoard package name.  See the [TensorBoard 1.6.0 release notes](\r\n  https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorboard/releases/tag/1.6.0) for a fix.\r\n\r\n## Thanks to our Contributors\r\n\r\nThis release contains contributions from many people at Google, as well as:\r\n\r\n4d55397500, Ag Ramesh, Aiden Scandella, Akimasa Kimura, Alex Rothberg, Allen Goodman,\r\namilioto, Andrei Costinescu, Andrei Nigmatulin, Anjum Sayed, Anthony Platanios,\r\nAnush Elangovan, Armando Fandango, Ashish Kumar Ram, Ashwini Shukla, Ben, Bhavani Subramanian,\r\nBrett Koonce, Carl Thomé, cclauss, Cesc, Changming Sun, Christoph Boeddeker, Clayne Robison,\r\nClemens Schulz, Clint (Woonhyuk Baek), codrut3, Cole Gerdemann, Colin Raffel, Daniel Trebbien,\r\nDaniel Ylitalo, Daniel Zhang, Daniyar, Darjan Salaj, Dave Maclachlan, David Norman, Dong--Jian,\r\ndongsamb, dssgsra, Edward H, eladweiss, elilienstein, Eric Lilienstein, error.d, Eunji Jeong, fanlu,\r\nFlorian Courtial, fo40225, Fred, Gregg Helt, Guozhong Zhuang, Hanchen Li, hsm207, hyunyoung2,\r\nImSheridan, Ishant Mrinal Haloi, Jacky Ko, Jay Young, Jean Flaherty, Jerome, JerrikEph, Jesse\r\nKinkead, jfaath, Jian Lin, jinghuangintel, Jiongyan Zhang, Joel Hestness, Joel Shor, Johnny Chan,\r\nJulian Niedermeier, Julian Wolff, JxKing, K-W-W, Karl Lessard, Kasper Marstal, Keiji Ariyama,\r\nKoan-Sin Tan, Loki Der Quaeler, Loo Rong Jie, Luke Schaefer, Lynn Jackson, ManHyuk, Matt Basta,\r\nMatt Smith, Matthew Schulkind, Michael, michaelkhan3, Miguel Piedrafita, Mikalai Drabovich,\r\nMike Knapp, mjwen, mktozk, Mohamed Aly, Mohammad Ashraf Bhuiyan, Myungjoo Ham, Naman Bhalla,\r\nNamrata-Ibm, Nathan Luehr, nathansilberman, Netzeband, Niranjan Hasabnis, Omar Aflak, Ozge\r\nYalcinkaya, Parth P Panchal, patrickzzy, Patryk Chrabaszcz, Paul Van Eck, Paweł Kapica, Peng Yu,\r\nPhilip Yang, Pierre Blondeau, Po-Hsien Chu, powderluv, Puyu Wang, Rajendra Arora, Rasmus, Renat\r\nIdrisov, resec, Robin Richtsfeld, Ronald Eddy Jr, Sahil Singh, Sam Matzek, Sami Kama, sandipmgiri,\r\nSantiago Castro, Sayed Hadi Hashemi, Scott Tseng, Sergii Khomenko, Shahid, Shengpeng Liu, Shreyash\r\nSharma, Shrinidhi Kl, Simone Cirillo, simsicon, Stanislav Levental, starsblinking, Stephen Lumenta,\r\nSteven Hickson, Su Tang, Taehoon Lee, Takuya Wakisaka, Ted Chang, Ted Ying, Tijmen Verhulsdonck,\r\nTimofey Kondrashov, vade, vaibhav, Valentin Khrulkov, vchigrin, Victor Costan, Viraj Navkal,\r\nVivek Rane, wagonhelm, Yan Facai (颜发才), Yanbo Liang, Yaroslav Bulatov, yegord, Yong Tang,\r\nYoni Tsafir, yordun, Yuan (Terry) Tang, Yuxin Wu, zhengdi, Zhengsheng Wei, 田传武"

    "body": "# Release 1.6.0\r\n\r\n## Breaking Changes\r\n* Prebuilt binaries are now built against CUDA 9.0 and cuDNN 7.\r\n* Prebuilt binaries will use AVX instructions. This may break TF on older CPUs.\r\n\r\n## Major Features And Improvements\r\n* New Optimizer internal API for non-slot variables. Descendants of AdamOptimizer that access _beta[12]_power will need to be updated.\r\n* `tf.estimator.{FinalExporter,LatestExporter}` now export stripped SavedModels. This improves forward compatibility of the SavedModel.\r\n* FFT support added to XLA CPU/GPU.\r\n* Android TF can now be built with CUDA acceleration on compatible Tegra devices (see [contrib/makefile/README.md](contrib/makefile/README.md) for more information)\r\n\r\n## Bug Fixes and Other Changes\r\n* Documentation updates:\r\n  * Added a second version of Getting Started, which is aimed at ML\r\nnewcomers.\r\n  * Clarified documentation on `resize_images.align_corners` parameter.\r\n  * Additional documentation for TPUs.\r\n* Google Cloud Storage (GCS):\r\n  * Add client-side throttle.\r\n  * Add a `FlushCaches()` method to the FileSystem interface, with an implementation for GcsFileSystem.\r\n* Other:\r\n  * Add `tf.contrib.distributions.Kumaraswamy`.\r\n  * `RetryingFileSystem::FlushCaches()` calls the base FileSystem's `FlushCaches()`.\r\n  * Add auto_correlation to distributions.\r\n  * Add `tf.contrib.distributions.Autoregressive`.\r\n  * Add SeparableConv1D layer.\r\n  * Add convolutional Flipout layers.\r\n  * When both inputs of `tf.matmul` are bfloat16, it returns bfloat16, instead of float32.\r\n  * Added `tf.contrib.image.connected_components`.\r\n  * Add `tf.contrib.framework.CriticalSection` that allows atomic variable access.\r\n  * Output variance over trees predictions for classifications tasks.\r\n  * For `pt` and `eval` commands, allow writing tensor values to filesystem as numpy files.\r\n  * gRPC: Propagate truncated errors (instead of returning gRPC internal error).\r\n  * Augment parallel_interleave to support 2 kinds of prefetching.\r\n  * Improved XLA support for C64-related ops log, pow, atan2, tanh.\r\n  * Add probabilistic convolutional layers.\r\n\r\n## API Changes\r\n* Introducing prepare_variance boolean with default setting to False for backward compatibility.\r\n* Move `layers_dense_variational_impl.py` to `layers_dense_variational.py`.\r\n\r\n## Known Bugs\r\n* Using XLA:GPU with CUDA 9 and CUDA 9.1 results in garbage results and/or\r\n  `CUDA_ILLEGAL_ADDRESS` failures.\r\n\r\n  Google discovered in mid-December 2017 that the PTX-to-SASS compiler in CUDA 9\r\n  and CUDA 9.1 sometimes does not properly compute the carry bit when\r\n  decomposing 64-bit address calculations with large offsets (e.g. `load [x +\r\n  large_constant]`) into 32-bit arithmetic in SASS.\r\n\r\n  As a result, these versions of `ptxas` miscompile most XLA programs which use\r\n  more than 4GB of temp memory.  This results in garbage results and/or\r\n  `CUDA_ERROR_ILLEGAL_ADDRESS` failures.\r\n\r\n  A fix in CUDA 9.1.121 is expected in late February 2018.  We do not expect a\r\n  fix for CUDA 9.0.x.  Until the fix is available, the only workaround is to\r\n  [downgrade](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit-archive) to CUDA 8.0.x\r\n  or disable XLA:GPU.\r\n\r\n  TensorFlow will print a warning if you use XLA:GPU with a known-bad version of\r\n  CUDA; see e00ba24c4038e7644da417ddc639169b6ea59122.\r\n* The `tensorboard` command or module may appear to be missing after certain\r\n  upgrade flows. This is due to pip package conflicts as a result of changing\r\n  the TensorBoard package name.  See the [TensorBoard 1.6.0 release notes](\r\n  https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorboard/releases/tag/1.6.0) for a fix.\r\n\r\n## Thanks to our Contributors\r\n\r\nThis release contains contributions from many people at Google, as well as:\r\n\r\n4d55397500, Ag Ramesh, Aiden Scandella, Akimasa Kimura, Alex Rothberg, Allen Goodman,\r\namilioto, Andrei Costinescu, Andrei Nigmatulin, Anjum Sayed, Anthony Platanios,\r\nAnush Elangovan, Armando Fandango, Ashish Kumar Ram, Ashwini Shukla, Ben, Bhavani Subramanian,\r\nBrett Koonce, Carl Thomé, cclauss, Cesc, Changming Sun, Christoph Boeddeker, Clayne Robison,\r\nClemens Schulz, Clint (Woonhyuk Baek), codrut3, Cole Gerdemann, Colin Raffel, Daniel Trebbien,\r\nDaniel Ylitalo, Daniel Zhang, Daniyar, Darjan Salaj, Dave Maclachlan, David Norman, Dong--Jian,\r\ndongsamb, dssgsra, Edward H, eladweiss, elilienstein, Eric Lilienstein, error.d, Eunji Jeong, fanlu,\r\nFlorian Courtial, fo40225, Fred, Gregg Helt, Guozhong Zhuang, Hanchen Li, hsm207, hyunyoung2,\r\nImSheridan, Ishant Mrinal Haloi, Jacky Ko, Jay Young, Jean Flaherty, Jerome, JerrikEph, Jesse\r\nKinkead, jfaath, Jian Lin, jinghuangintel, Jiongyan Zhang, Joel Hestness, Joel Shor, Johnny Chan,\r\nJulian Niedermeier, Julian Wolff, JxKing, K-W-W, Karl Lessard, Kasper Marstal, Keiji Ariyama,\r\nKoan-Sin Tan, Loki Der Quaeler, Loo Rong Jie, Luke Schaefer, Lynn Jackson, ManHyuk, Matt Basta,\r\nMatt Smith, Matthew Schulkind, Michael, michaelkhan3, Miguel Piedrafita, Mikalai Drabovich,\r\nMike Knapp, mjwen, mktozk, Mohamed Aly, Mohammad Ashraf Bhuiyan, Myungjoo Ham, Naman Bhalla,\r\nNamrata-Ibm, Nathan Luehr, nathansilberman, Netzeband, Niranjan Hasabnis, Omar Aflak, Ozge\r\nYalcinkaya, Parth P Panchal, patrickzzy, Patryk Chrabaszcz, Paul Van Eck, Paweł Kapica, Peng Yu,\r\nPhilip Yang, Pierre Blondeau, Po-Hsien Chu, powderluv, Puyu Wang, Rajendra Arora, Rasmus, Renat\r\nIdrisov, resec, Robin Richtsfeld, Ronald Eddy Jr, Sahil Singh, Sam Matzek, Sami Kama, sandipmgiri,\r\nSantiago Castro, Sayed Hadi Hashemi, Scott Tseng, Sergii Khomenko, Shahid, Shengpeng Liu, Shreyash\r\nSharma, Shrinidhi Kl, Simone Cirillo, simsicon, Stanislav Levental, starsblinking, Stephen Lumenta,\r\nSteven Hickson, Su Tang, Taehoon Lee, Takuya Wakisaka, Ted Chang, Ted Ying, Tijmen Verhulsdonck,\r\nTimofey Kondrashov, vade, vaibhav, Valentin Khrulkov, vchigrin, Victor Costan, Viraj Navkal,\r\nVivek Rane, wagonhelm, Yan Facai (颜发才), Yanbo Liang, Yaroslav Bulatov, yegord, Yong Tang,\r\nYoni Tsafir, yordun, Yuan (Terry) Tang, Yuxin Wu, zhengdi, Zhengsheng Wei, 田传武"

This may break TF on older CPUs.\r\n\r\n## Major Features And Improvements\r\n* [Eager execution](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/r1.5/tensorflow/contrib/eager) preview version is now available.\r\n* [TensorFlow Lite](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/r1.5/tensorflow/contrib/lite) dev preview is now available.\r\n* CUDA 9 and cuDNN 7 support.\r\n* Accelerated Linear Algebra (XLA):\r\n  * Add `complex64` support to XLA compiler.\r\n  * `bfloat` support is now added to XLA infrastructure.\r\n  * Make `ClusterSpec` propagation work with XLA devices.\r\n  * Use a determinisitic executor to generate XLA graph.\r\n* `tf.contrib`:\r\n  * `tf.contrib.distributions`:\r\n    * Add `tf.contrib.distributions.Autoregressive`.\r\n    * Make `tf.contrib.distributions` QuadratureCompound classes support batch\r\n    * Infer `tf.contrib.distributions.RelaxedOneHotCategorical` `dtype` from arguments.\r\n    * Make `tf.contrib.distributions` quadrature family parameterized by\r\n      `quadrature_grid_and_prob` vs `quadrature_degree`.\r\n    * `auto_correlation` added to `tf.contrib.distributions`\r\n  * Add `tf.contrib.bayesflow.layers`, a collection of probabilistic (neural) layers.\r\n  * Add `tf.contrib.bayesflow.halton_sequence`.\r\n  * Add `tf.contrib.data.make_saveable_from_iterator.`\r\n  * Add `tf.contrib.data.shuffle_and_repeat`.\r\n  * Add new custom transformation: `tf.contrib.data.scan()`.\r\n  * `tf.contrib.distributions.bijectors`:\r\n    * Add `tf.contrib.distributions.bijectors.MaskedAutoregressiveFlow`.\r\n    * Add `tf.contrib.distributions.bijectors.Permute`.\r\n    * Add `tf.contrib.distributions.bijectors.Gumbel`.\r\n    * Add `tf.contrib.distributions.bijectors.Reshape`.\r\n    * Support shape inference (i.e., shapes containing -1) in the Reshape bijector.\r\n* Add `streaming_precision_recall_at_equal_thresholds,` a method for computing streaming precision and recall with `O(num_thresholds + size of predictions)` time and space complexity.\r\n* Change `RunConfig` default behavior to not set a random seed, making random behavior independently random on distributed workers. We expect this to generally improve training performance. Models that do rely on determinism should set a random seed explicitly.\r\n* Replaced the implementation of `tf.flags` with `absl.flags`.\r\n* Add support for `CUBLAS_TENSOR_OP_MATH` in fp16 GEMM\r\n* Add support for CUDA on NVIDIA Tegra devices\r\n\r\n## Bug Fixes and Other Changes\r\n* Documentation updates:\r\n  * Clarified that you can only install TensorFlow on 64-bit machines.\r\n  * Added a short doc explaining how `Estimator`s save checkpoints.\r\n  * Add documentation for ops supported by the `tf2xla` bridge.\r\n  * Fix minor typos in the doc of `SpaceToDepth` and `DepthToSpace`.\r\n  * Updated documentation comments in `mfcc_mel_filterbank.h` and `mfcc.h` to clarify that the input domain is squared magnitude spectra and the weighting is done on linear magnitude spectra (sqrt of inputs).\r\n  * Change `tf.contrib.distributions` docstring examples to use `tfd` alias rather than `ds`, `bs`.\r\n  * Fix docstring typos in `tf.distributions.bijectors.Bijector`.\r\n  * `tf.assert_equal` no longer raises `ValueError.` It now raises `InvalidArgumentError,` as documented.\r\n  * Update Getting Started docs and API intro.\r\n* Google Cloud Storage (GCS):\r\n  * Add userspace DNS caching for the GCS client.\r\n  * Customize request timeouts for the GCS filesystem.\r\n  * Improve GCS filesystem caching.\r\n* Bug Fixes:\r\n  * Fix bug where partitioned integer variables got their wrong shapes. Before\r\n  * Fix correctness bug in CPU and GPU implementations of Adadelta.\r\n  * Fix a bug in `import_meta_graph`'s handling of partitioned variables when importing into a scope. WARNING: This may break loading checkpoints of graphs with partitioned variables saved after using `import_meta_graph` with a non-empty `import_scope` argument.\r\n  * Fix bug in offline debugger which prevented viewing events.\r\n  * Added the `WorkerService.DeleteWorkerSession` method to the gRPC interface, to fix a memory leak.

    "body": "# Release 1.4.0\r\n\r\n## Major Features And Improvements\r\n* `tf.keras` is now part of the core TensorFlow API.\r\n* [`tf.data`](http://tensorflow.org/programmers_guide/datasets) is now part of\r\n  the core TensorFlow API.\r\n  * The API is now subject to backwards compatibility guarantees.\r\n  * For a guide to migrating from the `tf.contrib.data` API, see the\r\n    [README](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/r1.4/tensorflow/contrib/data/README.md).\r\n  * Major new features include `Dataset.from_generator()` (for building an input\r\n    pipeline from a Python generator), and the `Dataset.apply()` method for\r\n    applying custom transformation functions.\r\n  * Several custom transformation functions have been added, including\r\n    `tf.contrib.data.batch_and_drop_remainder()` and\r\n    `tf.contrib.data.sloppy_interleave()`.\r\n* Add `train_and_evaluate` for simple distributed `Estimator` training.\r\n* Add `tf.spectral.dct` for computing the DCT-II.\r\n* Add Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficient support to `tf.contrib.signal`\r\n  (with GPU and gradient support).\r\n* Add a self-check on `import tensorflow` for Windows DLL issues.\r\n* Add NCHW support to `tf.depth_to_space` on GPU.\r\n* TensorFlow Debugger (tfdbg):\r\n  * Add `eval` command to allow evaluation of arbitrary Python/numpy expressions\r\n    in tfdbg command-line interface. See\r\n    [Debugging TensorFlow Programs](https://www.tensorflow.org/programmers_guide/debugger)\r\n    for more details.\r\n  * Usability improvement: The frequently used tensor filter `has_inf_or_nan` is\r\n    now added to `Session` wrappers and hooks by default. So there is no need\r\n    for clients to call `.add_tensor_filter(tf_debug.has_inf_or_nan)` anymore.\r\n* SinhArcsinh (scalar) distribution added to `contrib.distributions`.\r\n* Make `GANEstimator` opensource.\r\n* `Estimator.export_savedmodel()` now includes all valid serving signatures\r\n  that can be constructed from the Serving Input Receiver and all available\r\n  ExportOutputs. For instance, a classifier may provide regression- and\r\n  prediction-flavored outputs, in addition to the classification-flavored one.\r\n  Building signatures from these allows TF Serving to honor requests using the\r\n  different APIs (Classify, Regress, and Predict). Furthermore,\r\n  `serving_input_receiver_fn()` may now specify alternative subsets of nodes\r\n  that may act as inputs. This allows, for instance, producing a prediction\r\n  signature for a classifier that accepts raw `Tensors` instead of a serialized\r\n  `tf.Example`.\r\n* Add `tf.contrib.bayesflow.hmc`.\r\n* Add `tf.contrib.distributions.MixtureSameFamily`.\r\n* Make `Dataset.shuffle()` always reshuffles after each iteration by default.\r\n* Add `tf.contrib.bayesflow.metropolis_hastings`.\r\n* Add `log_rate` parameter to `tf.contrib.distributions.Poisson`.\r\n* Extend `tf.contrib.distributions.bijector` API to handle some non-injective\r\n  transforms.\r\n* Java:\r\n  * Generics (e.g., `Tensor<Integer>`) for improved type-safety\r\n    (courtesy @andrewcmyers).\r\n  * Support for multi-dimensional string tensors.\r\n  * Support loading of custom operations (e.g. many in `tf.contrib`) on Linux\r\n    and OS X\r\n* All our prebuilt binaries have been built with CUDA 8 and cuDNN 6.\r\n  We anticipate releasing TensorFlow 1.5 with CUDA 9 and cuDNN 7.\r\n\r\n## Bug Fixes and Other Changes\r\n* `tf.nn.rnn_cell.DropoutWrapper` is now more careful about dropping out LSTM\r\n  states.  Specifically, it no longer ever drops the `c` (memory) state of an\r\n  `LSTMStateTuple`.  The new behavior leads to proper dropout behavior\r\n  for LSTMs and stacked LSTMs.  This bug fix follows recommendations from\r\n  published literature, but is a behavioral change.  State dropout behavior\r\n  may be customized via the new `dropout_state_filter_visitor` argument.\r\n* Removed `tf.contrib.training.python_input`.  The same behavior, in a more\r\n  flexible and reproducible package, is available via the new\r\n  `tf.contrib.data.Dataset.from_generator` method!\r\n* Fix `tf.contrib.distributions.Affine` incorrectly computing log-det-jacobian.\r\n* Fix `tf.random_gamma` incorrectly handling non-batch, scalar draws.\r\n* Resolved a race condition in TensorForest TreePredictionsV4Op.\r\n* Google Cloud Storage file system, Amazon S3 file system, and Hadoop file\r\n  system support are now default build options.\r\n* Custom op libraries must link against libtensorflow_framework.so\r\n  (installed at `tf.sysconfig.get_lib()`).\r\n* Change `RunConfig` default behavior to not set a random seed, making random\r\n  behavior independently random on distributed workers. We expect this to\r\n  generally improve training performance. Models that do rely on determinism\r\n  should set a random seed explicitly.\r\n\r\n## Breaking Changes to the API\r\n* The signature of the `tf.contrib.data.rejection_resample()` function has been\r\n  changed. It now returns a function that can be used as an argument to\r\n  `Dataset.apply()`.\r\n* Remove `tf.contrib.data.Iterator.from_dataset()` method. Use\r\n  `Dataset.make_initializable_iterator()` instead.\r\n* Remove seldom used and unnecessary `tf.contrib.data.Iterator.dispose_op()`.\r\n* Reorder some TFGAN loss functions in a non-backwards compatible way.\r\n\r\n## Known Issues\r\n* In Python 3, `Dataset.from_generator()` does not support Unicode strings.\r\n  You must convert any strings to bytes objects before yielding them from\r\n  the generator.\r\n\r\n## Thanks to our Contributors\r\n\r\nThis release contains contributions from many people at Google, as well as:\r\n\r\n4d55397500, Abdullah Alrasheed, abenmao, Adam Salvail, Aditya Dhulipala, Ag Ramesh,\r\nAkimasa Kimura, Alan Du, Alan Yee, Alexander, Amit Kushwaha, Amy, Andrei Costinescu,\r\nAndrei Nigmatulin, Andrew Erlichson, Andrew Myers, Andrew Stepanov, Androbin, AngryPowman,\r\nAnish Shah, Anton Daitche, Artsiom Chapialiou, asdf2014, Aseem Raj Baranwal, Ash Hall,\r\nBart Kiers, Batchu Venkat Vishal, ben, Ben Barsdell, Bill Piel, Carl Thomé, Catalin Voss,\r\nChangming Sun, Chengzhi Chen, Chi Zeng, Chris Antaki, Chris Donahue, Chris Oelmueller,\r\nChris Tava, Clayne Robison, Codrut, Courtial Florian, Dalmo Cirne, Dan J, Darren Garvey,\r\nDavid Kristoffersson, David Norman, David RöThlisberger, DavidNorman, Dhruv, DimanNe,\r\nDorokhov, Duncan Mac-Vicar P, EdwardDixon, EMCP, error.d, FAIJUL, Fan Xia,\r\nFrancois Xavier, Fred Reiss, Freedom\" Koan-Sin Tan, Fritz Obermeyer, Gao, Xiang,\r\nGuenther Schmuelling, Guo Yejun (郭叶军), Hans Gaiser, HectorSVC, Hyungsuk Yoon,\r\nJames Pruegsanusak, Jay Young, Jean Wanka, Jeff Carpenter, Jeremy Rutman, Jeroen BéDorf,\r\nJett Jones, Jimmy Jia, jinghuangintel, jinze1994, JKurland, Joel Hestness, joetoth,\r\nJohn B Nelson, John Impallomeni, John Lawson, Jonas, Jonathan Dekhtiar, joshkyh, Jun Luan,\r\nJun Mei, Kai Sasaki, Karl Lessard, karl@kubx.ca, Kb Sriram, Kenichi Ueno, Kevin Slagle,\r\nKongsea, Lakshay Garg, lhlmgr, Lin Min, liu.guangcong, Loki Der Quaeler, Louie Helm,\r\nlucasmoura, Luke Iwanski, Lyndon White, Mahmoud Abuzaina, Marcel Puyat, Mark Aaron Shirley,\r\nMichele Colombo, MtDersvan, Namrata-Ibm, Nathan Luehr, Naurril, Nayana Thorat, Nicolas Lopez,\r\nNiranjan Hasabnis, Nolan Liu, Nouce, Oliver Hennigh, osdamv, Patrik Erdes,\r\nPatryk Chrabaszcz, Pavel Christof, Penghao Cen, postBG, Qingqing Cao, Qingying Chen, qjivy,\r\nRaphael, Rasmi, raymondxyang, Renze Yu, resec, Roffel, Ruben Vereecken, Ryohei Kuroki,\r\nsandipmgiri, Santiago Castro, Scott Kirkland, Sean Vig, Sebastian Raschka, Sebastian Weiss,\r\nSergey Kolesnikov, Sergii Khomenko, Shahid, Shivam Kotwalia, Stuart Berg, Sumit Gouthaman,\r\nsuperzerg, Sven Mayer, tetris, Ti Zhou, Tiago Freitas Pereira, Tian Jin, Tomoaki Oiki,\r\nVaibhav Sood, vfdev, Vivek Rane, Vladimir Moskva, wangqr, Weber Xie, Will Frey,\r\nYan Facai (颜发才), yanivbl6, Yaroslav Bulatov, Yixing Lao, Yong Tang, youkaichao,\r\nYuan (Terry) Tang, Yue Zhang, Yuxin Wu, Ziming Dong, ZxYuan, 黄璞\r\n\r\nWe are also grateful to all who filed issues or helped resolve them, asked and\r\nanswered questions, and were part of inspiring discussions."

    "body": "# Release 1.4.0\r\n\r\n## Major Features And Improvements\r\n* `tf.data` is now part of the core TensorFlow API.\r\n  * The API is now subject to backwards compatibility guarantees.\r\n  * For a guide to migrating from the `tf.contrib.data` API, see the\r\n    [README](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/r1.4/tensorflow/contrib/data/README.md).\r\n  * Major new features include `Dataset.from_generator()` (for building an input\r\n    pipeline from a Python generator), and the `Dataset.apply()` method for\r\n    applying custom transformation functions.\r\n  * Several custom transformation functions have been added, including\r\n    `tf.contrib.data.batch_and_drop_remainder()` and\r\n    `tf.contrib.data.sloppy_interleave()`.\r\n* Add `train_and_evaluate` for simple distributed `Estimator` training.\r\n* Add `tf.spectral.dct` for computing the DCT-II.\r\n* Add Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficient support to `tf.contrib.signal`\r\n  (with GPU and gradient support).\r\n* Add a self-check on `import tensorflow` for Windows DLL issues.\r\n* Add NCHW support to `tf.depth_to_space` on GPU.\r\n* SinhArcsinh (scalar) distribution added to `contrib.distributions`.\r\n* Make `GANEstimator` opensource.\r\n* `Estimator.export_savedmodel()` now includes all valid serving signatures\r\n  that can be constructed from the Serving Input Receiver and all available\r\n  ExportOutputs. For instance, a classifier may provide regression- and\r\n  prediction-flavored outputs, in addition to the classification-flavored one.\r\n  Building signatures from these allows TF Serving to honor requests using the\r\n  different APIs (Classify, Regress, and Predict). Furthermore,\r\n  `serving_input_receiver_fn()` may now specify alternative subsets of nodes\r\n  that may act as inputs. This allows, for instance, producing a prediction\r\n  signature for a classifier that accepts raw `Tensors` instead of a serialized\r\n  `tf.Example`.\r\n* Add `tf.contrib.bayesflow.hmc`.\r\n* Add `tf.contrib.distributions.MixtureSameFamily`.\r\n* Make `Dataset.shuffle()` always reshuffles after each iteration by default.\r\n* Add `tf.contrib.bayesflow.metropolis_hastings`.\r\n* Add `log_rate` parameter to `tf.contrib.distributions.Poisson`.\r\n* Extend `tf.contrib.distributions.bijector` API to handle some non-injective\r\n  transforms.\r\n* Java:\r\n  * Generics (e.g., `Tensor<Integer>`) for improved type-safety\r\n    (courtesy @andrewcmyers).\r\n  * Support for multi-dimensional string tensors.\r\n  * Support loading of custom operations (e.g. many in `tf.contrib`) on Linux\r\n    and OS X\r\n\r\n## Bug Fixes and Other Changes\r\n* `tf.nn.rnn_cell.DropoutWrapper` is now more careful about dropping out LSTM\r\n  states.  Specifically, it no longer ever drops the `c` (memory) state of an\r\n  `LSTMStateTuple`.  The new behavior leads to proper dropout behavior\r\n  for LSTMs and stacked LSTMs.  This bug fix follows recommendations from\r\n  published literature, but is a behavioral change.  State dropout behavior\r\n  may be customized via the new `dropout_state_filter_visitor` argument.\r\n* Removed `tf.contrib.training.python_input`.  The same behavior, in a more\r\n  flexible and reproducible package, is available via the new\r\n  `tf.contrib.data.Dataset.from_generator` method!\r\n* Fix `tf.contrib.distributions.Affine` incorrectly computing log-det-jacobian.\r\n* Fix `tf.random_gamma` incorrectly handling non-batch, scalar draws.\r\n* Resolved a race condition in TensorForest TreePredictionsV4Op.\r\n* Google Cloud Storage file system and Hadoop file system support are now\r\n  default build options.\r\n\r\n## Breaking Changes to the API\r\n* The signature of the `tf.contrib.data.rejection_resample()` function has been\r\n  changed. It now returns a function that can be used as an argument to\r\n  `Dataset.apply()`.\r\n* Remove `tf.contrib.data.Iterator.from_dataset()` method. Use\r\n  `Dataset.make_initializable_iterator()` instead.\r\n* Remove seldom used and unnecessary `tf.contrib.data.Iterator.dispose_op()`.\r\n* Reorder some TFGAN loss functions in a non-backwards compatible way.\r\n\r\n## Thanks to our Contributors\r\n\r\nThis release contains contributions from many people at Google, as well as:\r\n\r\n4d55397500, Abdullah Alrasheed, abenmao, Adam Salvail, Aditya Dhulipala, Ag Ramesh,\r\nAkimasa Kimura, Alan Du, Alan Yee, Alexander, Amit Kushwaha, Amy, Andrei Costinescu,\r\nAndrei Nigmatulin, Andrew Erlichson, Andrew Myers, Andrew Stepanov, Androbin, AngryPowman,\r\nAnish Shah, Anton Daitche, Artsiom Chapialiou, asdf2014, Aseem Raj Baranwal, Ash Hall,\r\nBart Kiers, Batchu Venkat Vishal, ben, Ben Barsdell, Bill Piel, Carl Thomé, Catalin Voss,\r\nChangming Sun, Chengzhi Chen, Chi Zeng, Chris Antaki, Chris Donahue, Chris Oelmueller,\r\nChris Tava, Clayne Robison, Codrut, Courtial Florian, Dalmo Cirne, Dan J, Darren Garvey,\r\nDavid Kristoffersson, David Norman, David RöThlisberger, DavidNorman, Dhruv, DimanNe,\r\nDorokhov, Duncan Mac-Vicar P, EdwardDixon, EMCP, error.d, FAIJUL, Fan Xia,\r\nFrancois Xavier, Fred Reiss, Freedom\" Koan-Sin Tan, Fritz Obermeyer, Gao, Xiang,\r\nGuenther Schmuelling, Guo Yejun (郭叶军), Hans Gaiser, HectorSVC, Hyungsuk Yoon,\r\nJames Pruegsanusak, Jay Young, Jean Wanka, Jeff Carpenter, Jeremy Rutman, Jeroen BéDorf,\r\nJett Jones, Jimmy Jia, jinghuangintel, jinze1994, JKurland, Joel Hestness, joetoth,\r\nJohn B Nelson, John Impallomeni, John Lawson, Jonas, Jonathan Dekhtiar, joshkyh, Jun Luan,\r\nJun Mei, Kai Sasaki, Karl Lessard, karl@kubx.ca, Kb Sriram, Kenichi Ueno, Kevin Slagle,\r\nKongsea, Lakshay Garg, lhlmgr, Lin Min, liu.guangcong, Loki Der Quaeler, Louie Helm,\r\nlucasmoura, Luke Iwanski, Lyndon White, Mahmoud Abuzaina, Marcel Puyat, Mark Aaron Shirley,\r\nMichele Colombo, MtDersvan, Namrata-Ibm, Nathan Luehr, Naurril, Nayana Thorat, Nicolas Lopez,\r\nNiranjan Hasabnis, Nolan Liu, Nouce, Oliver Hennigh, osdamv, Patrik Erdes,\r\nPatryk Chrabaszcz, Pavel Christof, Penghao Cen, postBG, Qingqing Cao, Qingying Chen, qjivy,\r\nRaphael, Rasmi, raymondxyang, Renze Yu, resec, Roffel, Ruben Vereecken, Ryohei Kuroki,\r\nsandipmgiri, Santiago Castro, Scott Kirkland, Sean Vig, Sebastian Raschka, Sebastian Weiss,\r\nSergey Kolesnikov, Sergii Khomenko, Shahid, Shivam Kotwalia, Stuart Berg, Sumit Gouthaman,\r\nsuperzerg, Sven Mayer, tetris, Ti Zhou, Tiago Freitas Pereira, Tian Jin, Tomoaki Oiki,\r\nVaibhav Sood, vfdev, Vivek Rane, Vladimir Moskva, wangqr, Weber Xie, Will Frey,\r\nYan Facai (颜发才), yanivbl6, Yaroslav Bulatov, Yixing Lao, Yong Tang, youkaichao,\r\nYuan (Terry) Tang, Yue Zhang, Yuxin Wu, Ziming Dong, ZxYuan, 黄璞\r\n\r\nWe are also grateful to all who filed issues or helped resolve them, asked and\r\nanswered questions, and were part of inspiring discussions."

List of added estimators:\r\n  * `DNNClassifier`\r\n  * `DNNRegressor`\r\n  * `LinearClassifier`\r\n  * `LinearRegressor`\r\n  * `DNNLinearCombinedClassifier`\r\n  * `DNNLinearCombinedRegressor`.\r\n* All our prebuilt binaries have been built with cuDNN 6. We anticipate releasing TensorFlow 1.4 with cuDNN 7.\r\n* `import tensorflow` now goes much faster.\r\n* Adds a file cache to the GCS filesystem with configurable max staleness for file contents. This permits caching of file contents across close/open boundaries.\r\n* Added an axis parameter to `tf.gather`.\r\n* Added a `constant_values` keyword argument to `tf.pad`.\r\n* Adds `Dataset.interleave` transformation.\r\n* Add `ConcatenateDataset` to concatenate two datasets.\r\n* Added Mobilenet support to TensorFlow for Poets training script.\r\n* Adds a block cache to the GCS filesystem with configurable block size and count.\r\n* SinhArcSinh bijector added.\r\n* Added `Dataset.list_files` API.\r\n* Introduces new operations and Python bindings for the Cloud TPU.\r\n* Adding TensorFlow-iOS CocoaPod for symmetry with tensorflow-android.\r\n* Introduces base implementations of ClusterResolvers.\r\n* Unify memory representations of TensorShape and PartialTensorShape. As a consequence, tensors now have a maximum of 254 dimensions, not 255.\r\n* Changed references to LIBXSMM to use version 1.8.1.\r\n* TensorFlow Debugger (tfdbg):\r\n  * Display summaries of numeric tensor values with the `-s` flag to command `print_tensor` or `pt`.\r\n  * Display feed values with the `print_feed` or `pf` command and clickable links in the curses UI.\r\n  * Runtime profiler at the op level and the Python source line level with the `run -p` command.\r\n* Initial release of the statistical distribution library `tf.distributions`.\r\n* GPU kernels and speed improvements for for unary `tf.where` and `tf.nn.top_k`.\r\n* Monotonic Attention wrappers added to `tf.contrib.seq2seq`.\r\n* Added `tf.contrib.signal`, a library for signal processing primitives.\r\n* Added `tf.contrib.resampler`, containing CPU and GPU ops for differentiable resampling of images.\r\n\r\n## Breaking Changes to the API\r\n* `tf.RewriterConfig` was removed from the Python API after being available in 1.2 release candidates (it was never in an actual release). Graph rewriting is still available, just not as `tf.RewriterConfig`. Instead add an explicit import.\r\n* Breaking change to `tf.contrib.data.Dataset` APIs that expect a nested structure. Lists are now converted to `tf.Tensor` implicitly. You may need to change uses of lists to tuples in existing code. In addition, dicts are now supported as a nested structure.\r\n\r\n## Changes to contrib APIs\r\n* Adds tf.contrib.nn.rank_sampled_softmax_loss, a sampled-softmax variant that can improve rank loss.\r\n* `tf.contrib.metrics`.{streaming_covariance,streaming_pearson_correlation} modified to return nan when they have seen less or equal to 1 unit of weight.\r\n* Adds time series models to contrib. See contrib/timeseries/README.md for details.\r\n* Adds FULLY_CONNECTED Op to tensorflow/contrib/lite/schema.fbs\r\n\r\n## Known Issues\r\n* Tensorflow_gpu compilation fails with Bazel 0.5.3.\r\n\r\n## Bug Fixes and Other Changes\r\n* Fixes `strides` and `begin` dtype mismatch when slicing using int64 Tensor index in python.\r\n* Improved convolution padding documentation.\r\n* Add a tag constant, gpu, to present graph with GPU support.\r\n* `saved_model.utils` now support SparseTensors transparently.\r\n* A more efficient implementation of non-max suppression.\r\n* Add support for the shrinkage-type L2 to FtrlOptimizer in addition to the online L2 it already supports.\r\n* Fix negative variance in moments calculation.\r\n* Expand UniqueOp Benchmark Tests to cover more collision cases.\r\n* Improves stability of GCS filesystem on Mac.\r\n* Add time estimation to HloCostAnalysis.\r\n* Fixed the bug in Estimator that params in constructor was not a deepcopy of the user provided one. This bugs inadvertently enabled user to mutate the params after the creation of Estimator, leading to potentially undefined behavior.\r\n* Added None check for save_path in `saver.restore`.\r\n* Register devices under their legacy names in device_mgr to ease the transition to clusterspec-propagated configurations.\r\n* VectorExponential added to distributions.\r\n* Add a bitwise module with bitwise_and, bitwise_or, bitwise_xor, and invert functions.\r\n* Add fixed-grid ODE integration routines.\r\n* Allow passing bounds to ScipyOptimizerInterface.\r\n* Correctness fixes for fft_length parameter to `tf.spectral.rfft` & `tf.spectral.irfft`.\r\n* Exported model signatures using the 'predict' method will no longer have their input and output keys silently ignored and rewritten to 'inputs' and 'outputs'. If a model was exported with different names before 1.2, and is now served with tensorflow/serving, it will accept requests using 'inputs' and 'outputs'. Starting at 1.2, such a model will accept the keys specified during export. Therefore, inference requests using 'inputs' and 'outputs' may start to fail. To fix this, either update any inference clients to send requests with the actual input and output keys used by the trainer code, or conversely, update the trainer code to name the input and output Tensors 'inputs' and 'outputs', respectively. Signatures using the 'classify' and 'regress' methods are not affected by this change; they will continue to standardize their input and output keys as before.\r\n* Add in-memory caching to the Dataset API.\r\n* Set default end_of_sequence variable in datasets iterators to false.\r\n* [Performance] Increase performance of `tf.layers.con2d` when setting use_bias=True by 2x by using nn.bias_add.\r\n* Update iOS examples to use CocoaPods, and moved to tensorflow/examples/ios.\r\n* Adds a family= attribute in `tf.summary` ops to allow controlling the tab name used in Tensorboard for organizing summaries.\r\n* When GPU is configured, do not require --config=cuda, instead, automatically build for GPU if this is requested in the configure script.\r\n* Fix incorrect sampling of small probabilities in CPU/GPU multinomial.\r\n* Add a list_devices() API on sessions to list devices within a cluster. Additionally, this change augment the ListDevices master API to support specifying a session.\r\n* Allow uses of over-parameterized separable convolution.\r\n* TensorForest multi-regression bug fix.\r\n* Framework now supports armv7, cocoapods.org now displays correct page.\r\n* Script to create iOS framework for CocoaPods.\r\n* Android releases of TensorFlow are now pushed to jcenter for easier integration into apps. See https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/contrib/android/README.md for more details.\r\n* TensorFlow Debugger (tfdbg):\r\n  * Fixed a bug that prevented tfdbg from functioning with multi-GPU setups.\r\n  * Fixed a bug that prevented tfdbg from working with `tf.Session.make_callable`.\r\n\r\n## Thanks to our Contributors\r\n\r\nThis release contains contributions from many people at Google, as well as:\r\n\r\n4F2E4A2E, Adriano Carmezim, Adrià Arrufat, Alan Yee, Alex Lattas, Alex Rothberg,\r\nAlexandr Baranezky, Ali Siddiqui, Andreas Solleder, Andrei Costinescu, Andrew Hundt,\r\nAndrobin, Andy Kernahan, Anish Shah, Anthony Platanios, Arvinds-Ds, b1rd, Baptiste\r\nArnaud, Ben Mabey, Benedikt Linse, Beomsu Kim, Bo Wang, Boyuan Deng, Brett Koonce,\r\nBruno Rosa, Carl Thomé, Changming Sun, Chase Roberts, Chirag Bhatia, Chris Antaki,\r\nChris Hoyean Song, Chris Tava, Christos Nikolaou, Croath Liu, cxx, Czxck001, Daniel\r\nYlitalo, Danny Goodman, Darren Garvey, David Brailovsky, David Norman, DavidNorman,\r\ndavidpham87, ddurham2, Dhruv, DimanNe, Drew Hintz, Dustin Tran, Earthson Lu, ethiraj,\r\nFabian Winnen, Fei Sun, Freedom\" Koan-Sin Tan, Fritz Obermeyer, Gao, Xiang, Gautam,\r\nGuenther Schmuelling, Gyu-Ho Lee, Hauke Brammer, horance, Humanity123, J Alammar,\r\nJayeol Chun, Jeroen BéDorf, Jianfei Wang, jiefangxuanyan, Jing Jun Yin, Joan Puigcerver,\r\nJoel Hestness, Johannes Mayer, John Lawson, Johnson145, Jon Malmaud, Jonathan Alvarez-Gutierrez,\r\nJuang, Yi-Lin, Julian Viereck, Kaarthik Sivashanmugam, Karl Lessard, karl@kubx.ca, Kevin\r\nCarbone, Kevin Van Der Burgt, Kongsea, ksellesk, lanhin, Lef Ioannidis, Liangliang He,\r\nLouis Tiao, Luke Iwanski, LáSzló Csomor, magixsno, Mahmoud Abuzaina, Marcel Hlopko, Mark\r\nNeumann, Maxwell Paul Brickner, mdfaijul, MichaëL Defferrard, Michał JastrzęBski, Michele\r\nColombo, Mike Brodie, Mosnoi Ion, mouradmourafiq, myPrecious, Nayana Thorat,\r\nNeeraj Kashyap, Nelson Liu, Niranjan Hasabnis, Olivier Moindrot, orome, Pankaj Gupta, Paul\r\nVan Eck, peeyush18, Peng Yu, Pierre, preciousdp11, qjivy, Raingo, raoqiyu, ribx, Richard S.\r\nImaoka, Rishabh Patel, Robert Walecki, Rockford Wei, Ryan Kung, Sahil Dua, Sandip Giri, Sayed\r\nHadi Hashemi, sgt101, Shitian Ni, Shuolongbj, Siim PõDer, Simon Perkins, sj6077, SOLARIS,\r\nSpotlight0xff, Steffen Eberbach, Stephen Fox, superryanguo, Sven Mayer, Tapan Prakash,\r\nTiago Morais Morgado, Till Hoffmann, Tj Rana, Vadim Markovtsev, vhasanov, Wei Wu,\r\nwindead, Yan (Asta) Li, Yan Chen, Yann Henon, Yi Wang, Yong Tang, yorkie, Yuan (Terry)\r\nTang, Yuxin Wu, zhengjiajin, zhongzyd, 黄璞\r\n\r\nWe are also grateful to all who filed issues or helped resolve them, asked and\r\nanswered questions, and were part of inspiring discussions.\r\n"

    "body": "# Release 1.3.0\r\n\r\n## Major Features and Improvements\r\n* Added canned estimators to Tensorflow library. List of added estimators:\r\n  * `DNNClassifier`\r\n  * `DNNRegressor`\r\n  * `LinearClassifier`\r\n  * `LinearRegressor`\r\n  * `DNNLinearCombinedClassifier`\r\n  * `DNNLinearCombinedRegressor`.\r\n* All our prebuilt binaries have been built with cuDNN 6.\r\n* `import tensorflow` now goes much faster.\r\n* Adds a file cache to the GCS filesystem with configurable max staleness for file contents. This permits caching of file contents across close/open boundaries.\r\n* Added an axis parameter to `tf.gather`.\r\n* Added a `constant_values` keyword argument to `tf.pad`.\r\n* Adds `Dataset.interleave` transformation.\r\n* Add `ConcatenateDataset` to concatenate two datasets.\r\n* Added Mobilenet support to TensorFlow for Poets training script.\r\n* Adds a block cache to the GCS filesystem with configurable block size and count.\r\n* SinhArcSinh bijector added.\r\n* Added `Dataset.list_files` API.\r\n* Introduces new operations and Python bindings for the Cloud TPU.\r\n* Adding TensorFlow-iOS CocoaPod for symmetry with tensorflow-android.\r\n* Introduces base implementations of ClusterResolvers.\r\n* Unify memory representations of TensorShape and PartialTensorShape. As a consequence, tensors now have a maximum of 254 dimensions, not 255.\r\n* Changed references to LIBXSMM to use version 1.8.1.\r\n* TensorFlow Debugger (tfdbg):\r\n  * Display summaries of numeric tensor values with the `-s` flag to command `print_tensor` or `pt`.\r\n  * Display feed values with the `print_feed` or `pf` command and clickable links in the curses UI.\r\n  * Runtime profiler at the op level and the Python source line level with the `run -p` command.\r\n* Initial release of the statistical distribution library `tf.distributions`.\r\n* GPU kernels and speed improvements for for unary `tf.where` and `tf.nn.top_k`.\r\n* Monotonic Attention wrappers added to `tf.contrib.seq2seq`.\r\n* Added `tf.contrib.signal`, a library for signal processing primitives.\r\n* Added `tf.contrib.resampler`, containing CPU and GPU ops for differentiable resampling of images.\r\n\r\n## Breaking Changes to the API\r\n* `tf.RewriterConfig` was removed from the Python API after being available in 1.2 release candidates (it was never in an actual release). Graph rewriting is still available, just not as `tf.RewriterConfig`. Instead add an explicit import.\r\n* Breaking change to `tf.contrib.data.Dataset` APIs that expect a nested structure. Lists are now converted to `tf.Tensor` implicitly. You may need to change uses of lists to tuples in existing code. In addition, dicts are now supported as a nested structure.\r\n\r\n## Changes to contrib APIs\r\n* Adds tf.contrib.nn.rank_sampled_softmax_loss, a sampled-softmax variant that can improve rank loss.\r\n* `tf.contrib.metrics`.{streaming_covariance,streaming_pearson_correlation} modified to return nan when they have seen less or equal to 1 unit of weight.\r\n* Adds time series models to contrib. See contrib/timeseries/README.md for details.\r\n* Adds FULLY_CONNECTED Op to tensorflow/contrib/lite/schema.fbs\r\n\r\n## Bug Fixes and Other Changes\r\n* Fixes `strides` and `begin` dtype mismatch when slicing using int64 Tensor index in python.\r\n* Improved convolution padding documentation.\r\n* Add a tag constant, gpu, to present graph with GPU support.\r\n* `saved_model.utils` now support SparseTensors transparently.\r\n* A more efficient implementation of non-max suppression.\r\n* Add support for the shrinkage-type L2 to FtrlOptimizer in addition to the online L2 it already supports.\r\n* Fix negative variance in moments calculation.\r\n* Expand UniqueOp Benchmark Tests to cover more collision cases.\r\n* Improves stability of GCS filesystem on Mac.\r\n* Add time estimation to HloCostAnalysis.\r\n* Fixed the bug in Estimator that params in constructor was not a deepcopy of the user provided one. This bugs inadvertently enabled user to mutate the params after the creation of Estimator, leading to potentially undefined behavior.\r\n* Added None check for save_path in `saver.restore`.\r\n* Register devices under their legacy names in device_mgr to ease the transition to clusterspec-propagated configurations.\r\n* VectorExponential added to distributions.\r\n* Add a bitwise module with bitwise_and, bitwise_or, bitwise_xor, and invert functions.\r\n* Add fixed-grid ODE integration routines.\r\n* Allow passing bounds to ScipyOptimizerInterface.\r\n* Correctness fixes for fft_length parameter to `tf.spectral.rfft` & `tf.spectral.irfft`.\r\n* Exported model signatures using the 'predict' method will no longer have their input and output keys silently ignored and rewritten to 'inputs' and 'outputs'. If a model was exported with different names before 1.2, and is now served with tensorflow/serving, it will accept requests using 'inputs' and 'outputs'. Starting at 1.2, such a model will accept the keys specified during export. Therefore, inference requests using 'inputs' and 'outputs' may start to fail. To fix this, either update any inference clients to send requests with the actual input and output keys used by the trainer code, or conversely, update the trainer code to name the input and output Tensors 'inputs' and 'outputs', respectively. Signatures using the 'classify' and 'regress' methods are not affected by this change; they will continue to standardize their input and output keys as before.\r\n* Add in-memory caching to the Dataset API.\r\n* Set default end_of_sequence variable in datasets iterators to false.\r\n* [Performance] Increase performance of `tf.layers.con2d` when setting use_bias=True by 2x by using nn.bias_add.\r\n* Update iOS examples to use CocoaPods, and moved to tensorflow/examples/ios.\r\n* Adds a family= attribute in `tf.summary` ops to allow controlling the tab name used in Tensorboard for organizing summaries.\r\n* When GPU is configured, do not require --config=cuda, instead, automatically build for GPU if this is requested in the configure script.\r\n* Fix incorrect sampling of small probabilities in CPU/GPU multinomial.\r\n* Add a list_devices() API on sessions to list devices within a cluster. Additionally, this change augment the ListDevices master API to support specifying a session.\r\n* Allow uses of over-parameterized separable convolution.\r\n* TensorForest multi-regression bug fix.\r\n* Framework now supports armv7, cocoapods.org now displays correct page.\r\n* Script to create iOS framework for CocoaPods.\r\n* Android releases of TensorFlow are now pushed to jcenter for easier integration into apps. See https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/contrib/android/README.md for more details.\r\n* TensorFlow Debugger (tfdbg):\r\n  * Fixed a bug that prevented tfdbg from functioning with multi-GPU setups.\r\n  * Fixed a bug that prevented tfdbg from working with `tf.Session.make_callable`.\r\n\r\n## Thanks to our Contributors\r\n\r\nThis release contains contributions from many people at Google, as well as:\r\n\r\n4F2E4A2E, Adriano Carmezim, Adrià Arrufat, Alan Yee, Alex Lattas, Alex Rothberg,\r\nAlexandr Baranezky, Ali Siddiqui, Andreas Solleder, Andrei Costinescu, Andrew Hundt,\r\nAndrobin, Andy Kernahan, Anish Shah, Anthony Platanios, Arvinds-Ds, b1rd, Baptiste\r\nArnaud, Ben Mabey, Benedikt Linse, Beomsu Kim, Bo Wang, Boyuan Deng, Brett Koonce,\r\nBruno Rosa, Carl Thomé, Changming Sun, Chase Roberts, Chirag Bhatia, Chris Antaki,\r\nChris Hoyean Song, Chris Tava, Christos Nikolaou, Croath Liu, cxx, Czxck001, Daniel\r\nYlitalo, Danny Goodman, Darren Garvey, David Brailovsky, David Norman, DavidNorman,\r\ndavidpham87, ddurham2, Dhruv, DimanNe, Drew Hintz, Dustin Tran, Earthson Lu, ethiraj,\r\nFabian Winnen, Fei Sun, Freedom\" Koan-Sin Tan, Fritz Obermeyer, Gao, Xiang, Gautam,\r\nGuenther Schmuelling, Gyu-Ho Lee, Hauke Brammer, horance, Humanity123, J Alammar,\r\nJayeol Chun, Jeroen BéDorf, Jianfei Wang, jiefangxuanyan, Jing Jun Yin, Joan Puigcerver,\r\nJoel Hestness, Johannes Mayer, John Lawson, Johnson145, Jon Malmaud, Jonathan Alvarez-Gutierrez,\r\nJuang, Yi-Lin, Julian Viereck, Kaarthik Sivashanmugam, Karl Lessard, karl@kubx.ca, Kevin\r\nCarbone, Kevin Van Der Burgt, Kongsea, ksellesk, lanhin, Lef Ioannidis, Liangliang He,\r\nLouis Tiao, Luke Iwanski, LáSzló Csomor, magixsno, Mahmoud Abuzaina, Marcel Hlopko, Mark\r\nNeumann, Maxwell Paul Brickner, mdfaijul, MichaëL Defferrard, Michał JastrzęBski, Michele\r\nColombo, Mike Brodie, Mosnoi Ion, mouradmourafiq, myPrecious, Nayana Thorat,\r\nNeeraj Kashyap, Nelson Liu, Niranjan Hasabnis, Olivier Moindrot, orome, Pankaj Gupta, Paul\r\nVan Eck, peeyush18, Peng Yu, Pierre, preciousdp11, qjivy, Raingo, raoqiyu, ribx, Richard S.\r\nImaoka, Rishabh Patel, Robert Walecki, Rockford Wei, Ryan Kung, Sahil Dua, Sandip Giri, Sayed\r\nHadi Hashemi, sgt101, Shitian Ni, Shuolongbj, Siim PõDer, Simon Perkins, sj6077, SOLARIS,\r\nSpotlight0xff, Steffen Eberbach, Stephen Fox, superryanguo, Sven Mayer, Tapan Prakash,\r\nTiago Morais Morgado, Till Hoffmann, Tj Rana, Vadim Markovtsev, vhasanov, Wei Wu,\r\nwindead, Yan (Asta) Li, Yan Chen, Yann Henon, Yi Wang, Yong Tang, yorkie, Yuan (Terry)\r\nTang, Yuxin Wu, zhengjiajin, zhongzyd, 黄璞\r\n\r\nWe are also grateful to all who filed issues or helped resolve them, asked and\r\nanswered questions, and were part of inspiring discussions.\r\n"

See contrib/timeseries/README.md for details.\r\n* Adds FULLY_CONNECTED Op to tensorflow/contrib/lite/schema.fbs\r\n\r\n## Bug Fixes and Other Changes\r\n* Fixes 'strides' and 'begin' dtype mismatch when slicing using int64 Tensor index in python.\r\n* Improved convolution padding documentation.\r\n* Add a tag constant, gpu, to present graph with GPU support.\r\n* `saved_model.utils` now support SparseTensors transparently.\r\n* A more efficient implementation of non-max suppression.\r\n* Add support for the shrinkage-type L2 to FtrlOptimizer in addition to the online L2 it already supports.\r\n* Fix negative variance in moments calculation.\r\n* Expand UniqueOp Benchmark Tests to cover more collision cases.\r\n* Improves stability of GCS filesystem on Mac.\r\n* Add time estimation to HloCostAnalysis.\r\n* Fixed the bug in Estimator that params in constructor was not a deepcopy of the user provided one. This bugs inadvertently enabled user to mutate the params after the creation of Estimator, leading to potentially undefined behavior.\r\n* Added None check for save_path in `saver.restore`.\r\n* Register devices under their legacy names in device_mgr to ease the transition to clusterspec-propagated configurations.\r\n* VectorExponential added to distributions.\r\n* Add a bitwise module with bitwise_and, bitwise_or, bitwise_xor, and invert functions.\r\n* Add fixed-grid ODE integration routines.\r\n* Allow passing bounds to ScipyOptimizerInterface.\r\n* Correctness fixes for fft_length parameter to `tf.spectral.rfft` & `tf.spectral.irfft`.\r\n* Exported model signatures using the 'predict' method will no longer have their input and output keys silently ignored and rewritten to 'inputs' and 'outputs'. If a model was exported with different names before 1.2, and is now served with tensorflow/serving, it will accept requests using 'inputs' and 'outputs'. Starting at 1.2, such a model will accept the keys specified during export. Therefore, inference requests using 'inputs' and 'outputs' may start to fail. To fix this, either update any inference clients to send requests with the actual input and output keys used by the trainer code, or conversely, update the trainer code to name the input and output Tensors 'inputs' and 'outputs', respectively. Signatures using the 'classify' and 'regress' methods are not affected by this change; they will continue to standardize their input and output keys as before.\r\n* Add in-memory caching to the Dataset API.\r\n* Set default end_of_sequence variable in datasets iterators to false.\r\n* [Performance] Increase performance of `tf.layers.con2d` when setting use_bias=True by 2x by using nn.bias_add.\r\n* Update iOS examples to use CocoaPods, and moved to tensorflow/examples/ios.\r\n* Adds a family= attribute in `tf.summary` ops to allow controlling the tab name used in Tensorboard for organizing summaries.\r\n* When GPU is configured, do not require --config=cuda, instead, automatically build for GPU if this is requested in the configure script.\r\n* Fix incorrect sampling of small probabilities in CPU/GPU multinomial.\r\n* Add a list_devices() API on sessions to list devices within a cluster. Additionally, this change augment the ListDevices master API to support specifying a session.\r\n* Allow uses of over-parameterized separable convolution.\r\n* TensorForest multi-regression bug fix.\r\n* Framework now supports armv7, cocoapods.org now displays correct page.\r\n* Script to create iOS framework for CocoaPods.\r\n* Android releases of TensorFlow are now pushed to jcenter for easier integration into apps. See https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/contrib/android/README.md for more details.\r\n* Fixed a bug that prevented tfdbg from functioning with multi-GPU setups.\r\n* Fixed a bug that prevented tfdbg from working with `tf.Session.make_callable`.\r\n\r\n## Thanks to our Contributors\r\n\r\nThis release contains contributions from many people at Google, as well as:\r\n\r\n4F2E4A2E, Adriano Carmezim, Adrià Arrufat, Alan Yee, Alex Lattas, Alex Rothberg,\r\nAlexandr Baranezky, Ali Siddiqui, Andreas Solleder, Andrei Costinescu, Andrew Hundt,\r\nAndrobin, Andy Kernahan, Anish Shah, Anthony Platanios, Arvinds-Ds, b1rd, Baptiste\r\nArnaud, Ben Mabey, Benedikt Linse, Beomsu Kim, Bo Wang, Boyuan Deng, Brett Koonce,\r\nBruno Rosa, Carl Thomé, Changming Sun, Chase Roberts, Chirag Bhatia, Chris Antaki,\r\nChris Hoyean Song, Chris Tava, Christos Nikolaou, Croath Liu, cxx, Czxck001, Daniel\r\nYlitalo, Danny Goodman, Darren Garvey, David Brailovsky, David Norman, DavidNorman,\r\ndavidpham87, ddurham2, Dhruv, DimanNe, Drew Hintz, Dustin Tran, Earthson Lu, ethiraj,\r\nFabian Winnen, Fei Sun, Freedom\" Koan-Sin Tan, Fritz Obermeyer, Gao, Xiang, Gautam,\r\nGuenther Schmuelling, Gyu-Ho Lee, Hauke Brammer, horance, Humanity123, J Alammar,\r\nJayeol Chun, Jeroen BéDorf, Jianfei Wang, jiefangxuanyan, Jing Jun Yin, Joan Puigcerver,\r\nJoel Hestness, Johannes Mayer, John Lawson, Johnson145, Jon Malmaud, Jonathan Alvarez-Gutierrez,\r\nJuang, Yi-Lin, Julian Viereck, Kaarthik Sivashanmugam, Karl Lessard, karl@kubx.ca, Kevin\r\nCarbone, Kevin Van Der Burgt, Kongsea, ksellesk, lanhin, Lef Ioannidis, Liangliang He,\r\nLouis Tiao, Luke Iwanski, LáSzló Csomor, magixsno, Mahmoud Abuzaina, Marcel Hlopko, Mark\r\nNeumann, Maxwell Paul Brickner, mdfaijul, MichaëL Defferrard, Michał JastrzęBski, Michele\r\nColombo, Mike Brodie, Mosnoi Ion, mouradmourafiq, myPrecious, Nayana Thorat,\r\nNeeraj Kashyap, Nelson Liu, Niranjan Hasabnis, Olivier Moindrot, orome, Pankaj Gupta, Paul\r\nVan Eck, peeyush18, Peng Yu, Pierre, preciousdp11, qjivy, Raingo, raoqiyu, ribx, Richard S.\r\nImaoka, Rishabh Patel, Robert Walecki, Rockford Wei, Ryan Kung, Sahil Dua, Sandip Giri, Sayed\r\nHadi Hashemi, sgt101, Shitian Ni, Shuolongbj, Siim PõDer, Simon Perkins, sj6077, SOLARIS,\r\nSpotlight0xff, Steffen Eberbach, Stephen Fox, superryanguo, Sven Mayer, Tapan Prakash,\r\nTiago Morais Morgado, Till Hoffmann, Tj Rana, Vadim Markovtsev, vhasanov, Wei Wu,\r\nwindead, Yan (Asta) Li, Yan Chen, Yann Henon, Yi Wang, Yong Tang, yorkie, Yuan (Terry)\r\nTang, Yuxin Wu, zhengjiajin, zhongzyd, 黄璞\r\n\r\nWe are also grateful to all who filed issues or helped resolve them, asked and\r\nanswered questions, and were part of inspiring discussions."

    "body": "# Release 1.2.0\r\n\r\n## Major Features and Improvements\r\n* Python 3.6 support on Windows.\r\n* Added `tf.layers.conv3d_transpose` layer for spatio temporal deconvolution.\r\n* Added `tf.Session.make_callable()`, which provides a lower overhead means of running a similar step multiple times.\r\n* Added ibverbs-based RDMA support to contrib (courtesy @junshi15 from Yahoo).\r\n* `RNNCell` objects now subclass `tf.layers.Layer`.  The strictness described\r\n  in the TensorFlow 1.1 release is gone:  The first time an RNNCell is used,\r\n  it caches its scope.  All future uses of the RNNCell will reuse variables from\r\n  that same scope.  This is a breaking change from the behavior of RNNCells\r\n  in TensorFlow versions <= 1.0.1.  TensorFlow 1.1 had checks in place to\r\n  ensure old code works correctly with the new semantics; this version\r\n  allows more flexible uses of RNNCell but can lead to subtle errors if\r\n  using code meant for TensorFlow <= 1.0.1.  For example, writing:\r\n  `MultiRNNCell([lstm] * 5)` will now build a 5-layer LSTM stack where each\r\n  layer shares the **same** parameters.  To get 5 layers each with their own\r\n  parameters, write: `MultiRNNCell([LSTMCell(...) for _ in range(5)])`.\r\n  If at all unsure, first test your code with TF 1.1; ensure it raises no\r\n  errors, and then upgrade to TF 1.2.\r\n* TensorForest Estimator now supports SavedModel export for serving.\r\n* Support client-provided ClusterSpec's and propagate them to all workers to enable the creation of dynamic TensorFlow clusters.\r\n* TensorFlow C library now available for Windows.\r\n* We released a new open-source version of TensorBoard.\r\n* [`SavedModel CLI`](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/master/programmers_guide/saved_model_cli) tool available to inspect and execute MetaGraph in SavedModel\r\n* Android releases of TensorFlow are now pushed to jcenter for easier\r\n  integration into apps. See\r\n  https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/contrib/android/README.md\r\n  for more details.\r\n* RNNCells' variable names have been renamed for consistency with Keras layers.\r\n  Specifically, the previous variable names \"weights\" and \"biases\" have\r\n  been changed to \"kernel\" and \"bias\", respectively.\r\n  This may cause backward incompatibility with regard to your old\r\n  checkpoints containing such RNN cells, in which case you can use the tool\r\n  [checkpoint_convert script](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/contrib/rnn/python/tools/checkpoint_convert.py)\r\n  to convert the variable names in your old checkpoints.\r\n* Many of the RNN functions and classes that were in the `tf.nn` namespace\r\n  before the 1.0 release and which were moved to `tf.contrib.rnn` have now\r\n  been moved back to the core namespace.  This includes\r\n  `RNNCell`, `LSTMCell`, `GRUCell`, and a number of other cells.  These\r\n  now reside in `tf.nn.rnn_cell` (with aliases in `tf.contrib.rnn` for backwards\r\n  compatibility).  The original `tf.nn.rnn` function is now `tf.nn.static_rnn`,\r\n  and the bidirectional static and state saving static rnn functions are also\r\n  now back in the `tf.nn` namespace.\r\n\r\n  Notable exceptions are the `EmbeddingWrapper`, `InputProjectionWrapper` and\r\n  `OutputProjectionWrapper`,  which will slowly be moved to deprecation\r\n  in `tf.contrib.rnn`.  These are inefficient wrappers that should often\r\n  be replaced by calling `embedding_lookup` or `layers.dense` as pre- or post-\r\n  processing of the rnn.  For RNN decoding, this functionality has been replaced\r\n  with an alternative API in `tf.contrib.seq2seq`.\r\n* Intel MKL Integration (https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/tensorflow-optimizations-on-modern-intel-architecture). Intel developed a number of\r\n  optimized deep learning primitives: In addition to matrix multiplication and\r\n  convolution, these building blocks include:\r\n  Direct batched convolution\r\n  Pooling: maximum, minimum, average\r\n  Normalization: LRN, batch normalization\r\n  Activation: rectified linear unit (ReLU)\r\n  Data manipulation: multi-dimensional transposition (conversion), split,\r\n  concat, sum and scale.\r\n\r\n## Deprecations\r\n\r\n* TensorFlow 1.2 may be the last time we build with cuDNN 5.1. Starting with\r\n  TensorFlow 1.3, we will try to build all our prebuilt binaries with cuDNN 6.0.\r\n  While we will try to keep our source code compatible with cuDNN 5.1, it will\r\n  be best effort.\r\n\r\n## Breaking Changes to the API\r\n* `org.tensorflow.contrib.android.TensorFlowInferenceInterface` now throws exceptions where possible and has simplified method signatures.\r\n\r\n## Changes to contrib APIs\r\n* Added `tf.contrib.util.create_example`.\r\n* Added bilinear interpolation to `tf.contrib.image`.\r\n* Add `tf.contrib.stateless` for random ops with custom seed control.\r\n* MultivariateNormalFullCovariance added to contrib/distributions/\r\n* tensorflow/contrib/rnn undergoes RNN cell variable renaming for\r\n  consistency with Keras layers. Specifically, the previous variable names\r\n  \"weights\" and \"biases\" are changed to \"kernel\" and \"bias\", respectively.\r\n  This may cause backward incompatibility with regard to your old\r\n  checkpoints containing such RNN cells, in which case you can use the\r\n  [checkpoint_convert script](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/contrib/rnn/python/tools/checkpoint_convert.py)\r\n  to convert the variable names in your old checkpoints.\r\n* Added `tf.contrib.kernel_methods` module with Ops and estimators for primal\r\n  (explicit) kernel methods in TensorFlow.\r\n\r\n## Bug Fixes and Other Changes\r\n* In python, `Operation.get_attr` on type attributes returns the Python DType\r\n  version of the type to match expected get_attr documentation rather than the\r\n  protobuf enum.\r\n* Changed MIN_SDK version to 8.0 when building iOS libraries.\r\n* Fixed LIBXSMM integration.\r\n* Make decode_jpeg/decode_png/decode_gif handle all formats, since users frequently try to decode an image as the wrong type.\r\n* Improve implicit broadcasting lowering.\r\n* Improving stability of GCS/Bigquery clients by a faster retrying of stale transmissions.\r\n* Remove OpKernelConstruction::op_def() as part of minimizing proto dependencies.\r\n* VectorLaplaceDiag distribution added.\r\n* Android demo no longer requires libtensorflow_demo.so to run (libtensorflow_inference.so still required)\r\n* Added `categorical_column_with_vocabulary_file`.\r\n* Introduce ops for batching/unbatching tensors across Session::Run() calls.\r\n* Add tf.log_sigmoid(x) = tf.log(tf.sigmoid(x)) = -tf.nn.softplus(-x).\r\n* Changed hooks lists to immutable tuples, and now allow any iterable for the associated arguments.\r\n* Introduce TFDecorator.\r\n* Added an Mfcc op for speech feature generation.\r\n* Improved DirectSession::Run() overhead and error checking. Feeding a value of the wrong type will now synchronously raise an INVALID_ARGUMENT error instead of asynchronously raising an INTERNAL error. Code that depends on the (undefined) behavior when feeding a tensor of the wrong type may need to be updated.\r\n* Added unreduced NONE, and reduced MEAN options for losses. Removed \"WEIGHTED_\" prefix from other Reduction constants.\r\n* assertAllClose now handles dicts.\r\n* Added Gmock matcher for HloInstructions.\r\n* Add var name to errors on variable restore.\r\n* Added an AudioSpectrogram op for audio feature generation.\r\n* Added `reduction` arg to losses.\r\n* `tf.placeholder` can represent scalar shapes and partially known.\r\n* Remove estimator_spec(mode) argument.\r\n* Added an AudioSpectrogram op for audio feature generation.\r\n* TensorBoard disables all runs by default if there are more than 40 runs.\r\n* Removed old doc generator code.\r\n* GCS file system integration now supports domain buckets, e.g gs://bucket.domain.com/path.\r\n* Add `tf.summary.text` for outputting text to TensorBoard.\r\n* The \"run\" command of tfdbg's command-line interface now supports filtering of tensors by node name, op type and tensor dtype.\r\n* `tf.string_to_number` now supports int64 and float64 outputs.\r\n\r\n## Thanks to our Contributors\r\n\r\nThis release contains contributions from many people at Google, as well as:\r\n\r\n4F2E4A2E, Aaron Schumacher, Abhi Agg, admcrae, Adriano Carmezim, Adrià Arrufat,\r\nagramesh1, Akimitsu Seo, Alan Mosca, Alex Egg, Alex Rothberg, Alexander Heinecke,\r\nAlexander Matyasko, Alexandr Baranezky, Alexandre Caulier, Ali Siddiqui, Anand Venkat,\r\nAndrew Hundt, Androbin, Anmol Sharma, Arie, Arno Leist, Arron Cao, AuréLien Geron, Bairen Yi,\r\nBeomsu Kim, Carl Thomé, cfperez, Changming Sun, Corey Wharton, critiqjo, Dalei Li, Daniel\r\nRasmussen, Daniel Trebbien, DaríO Hereñú, David Eng, David Norman, David Y.

All future uses of the RNNCell will reuse variables from\r\n  that same scope.  This is a breaking change from the behavior of RNNCells\r\n  in TensorFlow versions <= 1.0.1.  TensorFlow 1.1 had checks in place to\r\n  ensure old code works correctly with the new semantics; this version\r\n  allows more flexible uses of RNNCell but can lead to subtle errors if\r\n  using code meant for TensorFlow <= 1.0.1.  For example, writing:\r\n  `MultiRNNCell([lstm] * 5)` will now build a 5-layer LSTM stack where each\r\n  layer shares the **same** parameters.  To get 5 layers each with their own\r\n  parameters, write: `MultiRNNCell([LSTMCell(...) for _ in range(5)])`.\r\n  If at all unsure, first test your code with TF 1.1; ensure it raises no\r\n  errors, and then upgrade to TF 1.2.\r\n* TensorForest Estimator now supports SavedModel export for serving.\r\n* Support client-provided ClusterSpec's and propagate them to all workers to enable the creation of dynamic TensorFlow clusters.\r\n* TensorFlow C library now available for Windows.\r\n* We released a new open-source version of TensorBoard.\r\n* [`SavedModel CLI`](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/master/programmers_guide/saved_model_cli) tool available to inspect and execute MetaGraph in SavedModel\r\n* Android releases of TensorFlow are now pushed to jcenter for easier\r\n  integration into apps. See\r\n  https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/contrib/android/README.md\r\n  for more details.\r\n* RNNCells' variable names have been renamed for consistency with Keras layers.\r\n  Specifically, the previous variable names \"weights\" and \"biases\" have\r\n  been changed to \"kernel\" and \"bias\", respectively.\r\n  This may cause backward incompatibility with regard to your old\r\n  checkpoints containing such RNN cells, in which case you can use the tool\r\n  [checkpoint_convert script](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/contrib/rnn/python/tools/checkpoint_convert.py)\r\n  to convert the variable names in your old checkpoints.\r\n* Many of the RNN functions and classes that were in the `tf.nn` namespace\r\n  before the 1.0 release and which were moved to `tf.contrib.rnn` have now\r\n  been moved back to the core namespace.  This includes\r\n  `RNNCell`, `LSTMCell`, `GRUCell`, and a number of other cells.  These\r\n  now reside in `tf.nn.rnn_cell` (with aliases in `tf.contrib.rnn` for backwards\r\n  compatibility).  The original `tf.nn.rnn` function is now `tf.nn.static_rnn`,\r\n  and the bidirectional static and state saving static rnn functions are also\r\n  now back in the `tf.nn` namespace.\r\n\r\n  Notable exceptions are the `EmbeddingWrapper`, `InputProjectionWrapper` and\r\n  `OutputProjectionWrapper`,  which will slowly be moved to deprecation\r\n  in `tf.contrib.rnn`.  These are inefficient wrappers that should often\r\n  be replaced by calling `embedding_lookup` or `layers.dense` as pre- or post-\r\n  processing of the rnn.  For RNN decoding, this functionality has been replaced\r\n  with an alternative API in `tf.contrib.seq2seq`.\r\n* Intel MKL Integration (https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/tensorflow-optimizations-on-modern-intel-architecture). Intel developed a number of\r\n  optimized deep learning primitives: In addition to matrix multiplication and\r\n  convolution, these building blocks include:\r\n  Direct batched convolution\r\n  Pooling: maximum, minimum, average\r\n  Normalization: LRN, batch normalization\r\n  Activation: rectified linear unit (ReLU)\r\n  Data manipulation: multi-dimensional transposition (conversion), split,\r\n  concat, sum and scale.\r\n\r\n## Deprecations\r\n\r\n* TensorFlow 1.2 may be the last time we build with cuDNN 5.1. Starting with\r\n  TensorFlow 1.3, we will try to build all our prebuilt binaries with cuDNN 6.0.\r\n  While we will try to keep our source code compatible with cuDNN 5.1, it will\r\n  be best effort.\r\n\r\n## Breaking Changes to the API\r\n* `org.tensorflow.contrib.android.TensorFlowInferenceInterface` now throws exceptions where possible and has simplified method signatures.\r\n\r\n## Changes to contrib APIs\r\n* Added `tf.contrib.util.create_example`.\r\n* Added bilinear interpolation to `tf.contrib.image`.\r\n* Add `tf.contrib.stateless` for random ops with custom seed control.\r\n* MultivariateNormalFullCovariance added to contrib/distributions/\r\n* tensorflow/contrib/rnn undergoes RNN cell variable renaming for\r\n  consistency with Keras layers. Specifically, the previous variable names\r\n  \"weights\" and \"biases\" are changed to \"kernel\" and \"bias\", respectively.\r\n  This may cause backward incompatibility with regard to your old\r\n  checkpoints containing such RNN cells, in which case you can use the\r\n  [checkpoint_convert script](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/contrib/rnn/python/tools/checkpoint_convert.py)\r\n  to convert the variable names in your old checkpoints.\r\n\r\n## Bug Fixes and Other Changes\r\n* In python, `Operation.get_attr` on type attributes returns the Python DType\r\n  version of the type to match expected get_attr documentation rather than the\r\n  protobuf enum.\r\n* Changed MIN_SDK version to 8.0 when building iOS libraries.\r\n* Fixed LIBXSMM integration.\r\n* Make decode_jpeg/decode_png/decode_gif handle all formats, since users frequently try to decode an image as the wrong type.\r\n* Improve implicit broadcasting lowering.\r\n* Improving stability of GCS/Bigquery clients by a faster retrying of stale transmissions.\r\n* Remove OpKernelConstruction::op_def() as part of minimizing proto dependencies.\r\n* VectorLaplaceDiag distribution added.\r\n* Android demo no longer requires libtensorflow_demo.so to run (libtensorflow_inference.so still required)\r\n* Added `categorical_column_with_vocabulary_file`.\r\n* Introduce ops for batching/unbatching tensors across Session::Run() calls.\r\n* Add tf.log_sigmoid(x) = tf.log(tf.sigmoid(x)) = -tf.nn.softplus(-x).\r\n* Changed hooks lists to immutable tuples, and now allow any iterable for the associated arguments.\r\n* Introduce TFDecorator.\r\n* Added an Mfcc op for speech feature generation.\r\n* Improved DirectSession::Run() overhead and error checking. Feeding a value of the wrong type will now synchronously raise an INVALID_ARGUMENT error instead of asynchronously raising an INTERNAL error. Code that depends on the (undefined) behavior when feeding a tensor of the wrong type may need to be updated.\r\n* Added unreduced NONE, and reduced MEAN options for losses. Removed \"WEIGHTED_\" prefix from other Reduction constants.\r\n* assertAllClose now handles dicts.\r\n* Added Gmock matcher for HloInstructions.\r\n* Add var name to errors on variable restore.\r\n* Added an AudioSpectrogram op for audio feature generation.\r\n* Added `reduction` arg to losses.\r\n* `tf.placeholder` can represent scalar shapes and partially known.\r\n* Remove estimator_spec(mode) argument.\r\n* Added an AudioSpectrogram op for audio feature generation.\r\n* TensorBoard disables all runs by default if there are more than 40 runs.\r\n* Removed old doc generator code.\r\n* GCS file system integration now supports domain buckets, e.g gs://bucket.domain.com/path.\r\n* Add `tf.summary.text` for outputting text to TensorBoard.\r\n* The \"run\" command of tfdbg's command-line interface now supports filtering of tensors by node name, op type and tensor dtype.\r\n* `tf.string_to_number` now supports int64 and float64 outputs.\r\n\r\n## Thanks to our Contributors\r\n\r\nThis release contains contributions from many people at Google, as well as:\r\n\r\n4F2E4A2E, Aaron Schumacher, Abhi Agg, admcrae, Adriano Carmezim, Adrià Arrufat,\r\nagramesh1, Akimitsu Seo, Alan Mosca, Alex Egg, Alex Rothberg, Alexander Heinecke,\r\nAlexander Matyasko, Alexandr Baranezky, Alexandre Caulier, Ali Siddiqui, Anand Venkat,\r\nAndrew Hundt, Androbin, Anmol Sharma, Arie, Arno Leist, Arron Cao, AuréLien Geron, Bairen Yi,\r\nBeomsu Kim, Carl Thomé, cfperez, Changming Sun, Corey Wharton, critiqjo, Dalei Li, Daniel\r\nRasmussen, Daniel Trebbien, DaríO Hereñú, David Eng, David Norman, David Y.

All future uses of the RNNCell will reuse variables from\r\n  that same scope.  This is a breaking change from the behavior of RNNCells\r\n  in TensorFlow versions <= 1.0.1.  TensorFlow 1.1 had checks in place to\r\n  ensure old code works correctly with the new semantics; this version\r\n  allows more flexible uses of RNNCell but can lead to subtle errors if\r\n  using code meant for TensorFlow <= 1.0.1.  For example, writing:\r\n  `MultiRNNCell([lstm] * 5)` will now build a 5-layer LSTM stack where each\r\n  layer shares the **same** parameters.  To get 5 layers each with their own\r\n  parameters, write: `MultiRNNCell([LSTMCell(...) for _ in range(5)])`.\r\n  If at all unsure, first test your code with TF 1.1; ensure it raises no\r\n  errors, and then upgrade to TF 1.2.\r\n* TensorForest Estimator now supports SavedModel export for serving.\r\n* Support client-provided ClusterSpec's and propagate them to all workers to enable the creation of dynamic TensorFlow clusters.\r\n* TensorFlow C library now available for Windows.\r\n* We released a new open-source version of TensorBoard.\r\n\r\n## Breaking Changes to the API\r\n* org.tensorflow.contrib.android.TensorFlowInferenceInterface now throws exceptions where possible and has simplified method signatures.\r\n\r\n## Changes to contrib APIs\r\n* Added `tf.contrib.util.create_example`.\r\n* Added bilinear interpolation to tf.contrib.image.\r\n* Add `tf.contrib.stateless` for random ops with custom seed control.\r\n* MultivariateNormalFullCovariance added to contrib/distributions/\r\n\r\n## Bug Fixes and Other Changes\r\n* In python, `Operation.get_attr` on type attributes returns the Python DType\r\n  version of the type to match expected get_attr documentation rather than the\r\n  protobuf enum.\r\n* Changed MIN_SDK version to 8.0 when building iOS libraries.\r\n* Fixed LIBXSMM integration.\r\n* Make decode_jpeg/decode_png/decode_gif handle all formats, since users frequently try to decode an image as the wrong type.\r\n* Improve implicit broadcasting lowering.\r\n* Improving stability of GCS/Bigquery clients by a faster retrying of stale transmissions.\r\n* Remove OpKernelConstruction::op_def() as part of minimizing proto dependencies.\r\n* VectorLaplaceDiag distribution added.\r\n* Android demo no longer requires libtensorflow_demo.so to run (libtensorflow_inference.so still required)\r\n* Added `categorical_column_with_vocabulary_file`.\r\n* Introduce ops for batching/unbatching tensors across Session::Run() calls.\r\n* Add tf.log_sigmoid(x) = tf.log(tf.sigmoid(x)) = -tf.nn.softplus(-x).\r\n* Changed hooks lists to immutable tuples, and now allow any iterable for the associated arguments.\r\n* Introduce TFDecorator.\r\n* Added an Mfcc op for speech feature generation.\r\n* Improved DirectSession::Run() overhead and error checking. Feeding a value of the wrong type will now synchronously raise an INVALID_ARGUMENT error instead of asynchronously raising an INTERNAL error. Code that depends on the (undefined) behavior when feeding a tensor of the wrong type may need to be updated.\r\n* Added unreduced NONE, and reduced MEAN options for losses. Removed \"WEIGHTED_\" prefix from other Reduction constants.\r\n* assertAllClose now handles dicts.\r\n* Added Gmock matcher for HloInstructions.\r\n* Add var name to errors on variable restore.\r\n* Added an AudioSpectrogram op for audio feature generation.\r\n* Added `reduction` arg to losses.\r\n* `tf.placeholder` can represent scalar shapes and partially known.\r\n* Remove estimator_spec(mode) argument.\r\n* Added an AudioSpectrogram op for audio feature generation.\r\n* TensorBoard disables all runs by default if there are more than 40 runs.\r\n* Removed old doc generator code.\r\n* GCS file system integration now supports domain buckets, e.g gs://bucket.domain.com/path.\r\n* Add `tf.summary.text` for outputting text to TensorBoard.\r\n* The \"run\" command of tfdbg's command-line interface now supports filtering of tensors by node name, op type and tensor dtype.\r\n* `tf.string_to_number` now supports int64 and float64 outputs.\r\n* `SavedModel CLI` tool available to inspect and execute MetaGraph in SavedModel\r\n\r\n## Thanks to our Contributors\r\n\r\nThis release contains contributions from many people at Google, as well as:\r\n\r\n4F2E4A2E, Aaron Schumacher, Abhi Agg, admcrae, Adriano Carmezim, Adrià Arrufat,\r\nagramesh1, Akimitsu Seo, Alan Mosca, Alex Egg, Alex Rothberg, Alexander Heinecke,\r\nAlexander Matyasko, Alexandr Baranezky, Alexandre Caulier, Ali Siddiqui, Anand Venkat,\r\nAndrew Hundt, Androbin, Anmol Sharma, Arie, Arno Leist, Arron Cao, AuréLien Geron, Bairen Yi,\r\nBeomsu Kim, Carl Thomé, cfperez, Changming Sun, Corey Wharton, critiqjo, Dalei Li, Daniel\r\nRasmussen, Daniel Trebbien, DaríO Hereñú, David Eng, David Norman, David Y.

TensorFlow can now be installed by `pip\n  install tensorflow` command.\n- Several python API calls have been changed to resemble NumPy more closely.\n- New (experimental) [Java API](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tensorflow/java).\n- Android: new person detection + tracking demo implementing \"Scalable Object Detection using Deep Neural Networks\" (with additional YOLO object detector support)\n- Android: new camera-based image stylization demo based on \"A Learned Representation For Artistic Style\"\n\n## Breaking Changes to the API\n\nTo help you upgrade your existing TensorFlow Python code to match the API changes below, we have prepared a [conversion script](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/r1.0/tensorflow/tools/compatibility).\n- TensorFlow/models have been moved to a separate github repository.\n- Division and modulus operators (/, //, %) now match Python (flooring)\n  semantics. This applies to `tf.div` and `tf.mod` as well. To obtain forced\n  integer truncation based behaviors you can use `tf.truncatediv`\n  and `tf.truncatemod`.\n- `tf.divide()` is now the recommended division function. `tf.div()` will\n  remain, but its semantics do not respond to Python 3 or `from future`\n  mechanisms.\n- tf.reverse() now takes indices of axes to be reversed. E.g.\n  `tf.reverse(a, [True, False, True])` must now be written as\n  `tf.reverse(a, [0, 2])`. `tf.reverse_v2()` will remain until 1.0 final.\n- `tf.mul`, `tf.sub` and `tf.neg` are deprecated in favor of `tf.multiply`,\n  `tf.subtract` and `tf.negative`.\n- `tf.pack` and `tf.unpack` are deprecated in favor of `tf.stack` and\n  `tf.unstack`.\n- `TensorArray.pack` and `TensorArray.unpack` are getting deprecated in favor of\n  `TensorArray.stack` and `TensorArray.unstack`.\n- The following Python functions have had their arguments changed to use `axis`\n  when referring to specific dimensions. We have kept the old keyword arguments\n  for compatibility currently, but we will be removing them well before the\n  final 1.0.\n  - `tf.argmax`: `dimension` becomes `axis`\n  - `tf.argmin`: `dimension` becomes `axis`\n  - `tf.count_nonzero`: `reduction_indices` becomes `axis`\n  - `tf.expand_dims`: `dim` becomes `axis`\n  - `tf.reduce_all`: `reduction_indices` becomes `axis`\n  - `tf.reduce_any`: `reduction_indices` becomes `axis`\n  - `tf.reduce_join`: `reduction_indices` becomes `axis`\n  - `tf.reduce_logsumexp`: `reduction_indices` becomes `axis`\n  - `tf.reduce_max`: `reduction_indices` becomes `axis`\n  - `tf.reduce_mean`: `reduction_indices` becomes `axis`\n  - `tf.reduce_min`: `reduction_indices` becomes `axis`\n  - `tf.reduce_prod`: `reduction_indices` becomes `axis`\n  - `tf.reduce_sum`: `reduction_indices` becomes `axis`\n  - `tf.reverse_sequence`: `batch_dim` becomes `batch_axis`, `seq_dim` becomes `seq_axis`\n  - `tf.sparse_concat`: `concat_dim` becomes `axis`\n  - `tf.sparse_reduce_sum`: `reduction_axes` becomes `axis`\n  - `tf.sparse_reduce_sum_sparse`: `reduction_axes` becomes `axis`\n  - `tf.sparse_split`: `split_dim` becomes `axis`\n- `tf.listdiff` has been renamed to `tf.setdiff1d` to match NumPy naming.\n- `tf.inv` has been renamed to be `tf.reciprocal` (component-wise reciprocal)\n  to avoid confusion with `np.inv` which is matrix inversion\n- tf.round now uses banker's rounding (round to even) semantics to match NumPy.\n- `tf.split` now takes arguments in a reversed order and with different\n  keywords. In particular, we now match NumPy order as\n  `tf.split(value, num_or_size_splits, axis)`.\n- `tf.sparse_split` now takes arguments in reversed order and with different\n  keywords. In particular we now match NumPy order as\n  `tf.sparse_split(sp_input, num_split, axis)`. NOTE: we have temporarily\n  made `tf.sparse_split` require keyword arguments.\n- `tf.concat` now takes arguments in reversed order and with different keywords. In particular we now match NumPy order as `tf.concat(values, axis, name)`.\n- `tf.image.decode_jpeg` by default uses the faster DCT method, sacrificing\n  a little fidelity for improved speed. One can revert to the old\n  behavior by specifying the attribute `dct_method='INTEGER_ACCURATE'`.\n- `tf.complex_abs` has been removed from the Python interface. `tf.abs`\n  supports complex tensors and should be used instead.\n- Template.`var_scope` property renamed to `.variable_scope`\n- SyncReplicasOptimizer is removed and SyncReplicasOptimizerV2 renamed to SyncReplicasOptimizer.\n- `tf.zeros_initializer()` and `tf.ones_initializer()` now return a callable\n  that must be called with initializer arguments, in your code replace\n  `tf.zeros_initializer` with `tf.zeros_initializer()`.\n- `SparseTensor.shape` has been renamed to `SparseTensor.dense_shape`.  Same for\n  `SparseTensorValue.shape`.\n- Replace tf.scalar_summary, tf.histogram_summary, tf.audio_summary, tf.image_summary with tf.summary.scalar, tf.summary.histogram, tf.summary.audio, tf.summary.image, respectively. The new summary ops take name rather than tag as their first argument, meaning summary ops now respect TensorFlow name scopes.\n- Replace tf.train.SummaryWriter and tf.train.SummaryWriterCache with tf.summary.FileWriter and tf.summary.FileWriterCache. \n- Removes RegisterShape from public API. Use C++ shape function registration\n  instead.\n- Deprecated `_ref` dtypes from the python API.\n- In the C++ API (in tensorflow/cc), Input, Output, etc. have moved\n  from the tensorflow::ops namespace to tensorflow.\n- Change arg order for `{softmax,sparse_softmax,sigmoid}_cross_entropy_with_logits` to be (labels, predictions), and force use of named args.\n- tf.nn.rnn_cell.\\* and most functions in tf.nn.rnn.\\* (with the exception of dynamic_rnn and raw_rnn) are temporarily in tf.contrib.rnn.  They will be moved back into core for TF 1.1.\n\n## Bug Fixes and Other Changes\n- Numerous C++ API updates.\n- New op: `parallel_stack`.\n- Introducing common tf io compression options constants for\n  RecordReader/RecordWriter.\n- Add `sparse_column_with_vocabulary_file`, to specify a feature column that\n  transform string features to IDs, where the mapping is defined by a vocabulary\n  file.\n- Added `index_to_string_table` which returns a lookup table that maps indices to\n  strings.\n- Add `string_to_index_table`, which returns a lookup table that matches strings\n  to indices.\n- Add a `ParallelForWithWorkerId` function.\n- Add `string_to_index_table`, which returns a lookup table that matches strings\n  to indices.\n- Support restore session from checkpoint files in v2 in `contrib/session_bundle`.\n- Added a tf.contrib.image.rotate function for arbitrary angles.\n- Added `tf.contrib.framework.filter_variables` as a convenience function to\n  filter lists of variables based on regular expressions.\n- `make_template()` takes an optional `custom_getter_ param`.\n- Added comment about how existing directories are handled by\n  `recursive_create_dir`.\n- Added an op for QR factorizations.\n- Divides and mods in Python API now use flooring (Python) semantics.\n- Android: pre-built libs are now built nightly.\n- Android: cmake/gradle build for TensorFlow Inference library under\n  `contrib/android/cmake`\n- Android: Much more robust Session initialization code.\n- Android: TF stats now exposed directly in demo and log when debug mode is\n  active\n- Android: new/better README.md documentation\n- saved_model is available as `tf.saved_model`.\n- Empty op is now stateful.\n- Improve speed of scatter_update on the cpu for ASSIGN operations.\n- Change `reduce_join` to treat `reduction_indices` in the same way as other `reduce_` ops.\n- Move `TensorForestEstimator` to `contrib/tensor_forest`.\n- Enable compiler optimizations by default and allow configuration in configure.\n- `tf.divide` now honors the name field.\n- Make metrics weight broadcasting more strict.\n- Add new queue-like `StagingArea` and new ops: `stage` and `unstage`.\n- Enable inplace update ops for strings on CPU. Speed up string concat.\n\n## Thanks to our Contributors\n\nThis release contains contributions from many people at Google, as well as:\n\nAaron Hu, Abhishek Aggarwal, Adam Michael, Adriano Carmezim, @AfirSraftGarrier,\nAlexander Novikov, Alexander Rosenberg Johansen, Andrew Gibiansky, Andrew Hundt,\nAnish Shah, Anton Loss, @b0noI, @BoyuanJiang, Carl Thomé, Chad Kennedy, Comic\nChang, Connor Braa, Daniel N.

We have kept the old keyword arguments\n  for compatibility currently, but we will be removing them well before the\n  final 1.0.\n  - `tf.argmax`: `dimension` becomes `axis`\n  - `tf.argmin`: `dimension` becomes `axis`\n  - `tf.count_nonzero`: `reduction_indices` becomes `axis`\n  - `tf.expand_dims`: `dim` becomes `axis`\n  - `tf.reduce_all`: `reduction_indices` becomes `axis`\n  - `tf.reduce_any`: `reduction_indices` becomes `axis`\n  - `tf.reduce_join`: `reduction_indices` becomes `axis`\n  - `tf.reduce_logsumexp`: `reduction_indices` becomes `axis`\n  - `tf.reduce_max`: `reduction_indices` becomes `axis`\n  - `tf.reduce_mean`: `reduction_indices` becomes `axis`\n  - `tf.reduce_min`: `reduction_indices` becomes `axis`\n  - `tf.reduce_prod`: `reduction_indices` becomes `axis`\n  - `tf.reduce_sum`: `reduction_indices` becomes `axis`\n  - `tf.reverse_sequence`: `batch_dim` becomes `batch_axis`, `seq_dim` becomes `seq_axis`\n  - `tf.sparse_concat`: `concat_dim` becomes `axis`\n  - `tf.sparse_reduce_sum`: `reduction_axes` becomes `axis`\n  - `tf.sparse_reduce_sum_sparse`: `reduction_axes` becomes `axis`\n  - `tf.sparse_split`: `split_dim` becomes `axis`\n- `tf.listdiff` has been renamed to `tf.setdiff1d` to match NumPy naming.\n- `tf.inv` has been renamed to be `tf.reciprocal` (component-wise reciprocal)\n  to avoid confusion with `np.inv` which is matrix inversion\n- tf.round now uses banker's rounding (round to even) semantics to match NumPy.\n- `tf.split` now takes arguments in a reversed order and with different\n  keywords. In particular, we now match NumPy order as\n  `tf.split(value, num_or_size_splits, axis)`.\n- `tf.sparse_split` now takes arguments in reversed order and with different\n  keywords. In particular we now match NumPy order as\n  `tf.sparse_split(sp_input, num_split, axis)`. NOTE: we have temporarily\n  made `tf.sparse_split` require keyword arguments.\n- `tf.concat` now takes arguments in reversed order and with different keywords. In particular we now match NumPy order as `tf.concat(values, axis, name)`.\n- `tf.image.decode_jpeg` by default uses the faster DCT method, sacrificing\n  a little fidelity for improved speed. One can revert to the old\n  behavior by specifying the attribute `dct_method='INTEGER_ACCURATE'`.\n- `tf.complex_abs` has been removed from the Python interface. `tf.abs`\n  supports complex tensors and should be used instead.\n- Template.`var_scope` property renamed to `.variable_scope`\n- SyncReplicasOptimizer is removed and SyncReplicasOptimizerV2 renamed to SyncReplicasOptimizer.\n- `tf.zeros_initializer()` and `tf.ones_initializer()` now return a callable\n  that must be called with initializer arguments, in your code replace\n  `tf.zeros_initializer` with `tf.zeros_initializer()`.\n- `SparseTensor.shape` has been renamed to `SparseTensor.dense_shape`.  Same for\n  `SparseTensorValue.shape`.\n- Replace tf.scalar_summary, tf.histogram_summary, tf.audio_summary, tf.image_summary with tf.summary.scalar, tf.summary.histogram, tf.summary.audio, tf.summary.image, respectively. The new summary ops take name rather than tag as their first argument, meaning summary ops now respect TensorFlow name scopes.\n- Replace tf.train.SummaryWriter and tf.train.SummaryWriterCache with tf.summary.FileWriter and tf.summary.FileWriterCache. \n- Removes RegisterShape from public API. Use C++ shape function registration\n  instead.\n- Deprecated `_ref` dtypes from the python API.\n- In the C++ API (in tensorflow/cc), Input, Output, etc. have moved\n  from the tensorflow::ops namespace to tensorflow.\n- Change arg order for `{softmax,sparse_softmax,sigmoid}_cross_entropy_with_logits` to be (labels, predictions), and force use of named args.\n\n## Bug Fixes and Other Changes\n- New op: `parallel_stack`.\n- Introducing common tf io compression options constants for\n  RecordReader/RecordWriter.\n- Add `sparse_column_with_vocabulary_file`, to specify a feature column that\n  transform string features to IDs, where the mapping is defined by a vocabulary\n  file.\n- Added `index_to_string_table` which returns a lookup table that maps indices to\n  strings.\n- Add `string_to_index_table`, which returns a lookup table that matches strings\n  to indices.\n- Add a `ParallelForWithWorkerId` function.\n- Add `string_to_index_table`, which returns a lookup table that matches strings\n  to indices.\n- Support restore session from checkpoint files in v2 in `contrib/session_bundle`.\n- Added a tf.contrib.image.rotate function for arbitrary angles.\n- Added `tf.contrib.framework.filter_variables` as a convenience function to\n  filter lists of variables based on regular expressions.\n- `make_template()` takes an optional `custom_getter_ param`.\n- Added comment about how existing directories are handled by\n  `recursive_create_dir`.\n- Added an op for QR factorizations.\n- Divides and mods in Python API now use flooring (Python) semantics.\n- Android: pre-built libs are now built nightly.\n- Android: cmake/gradle build for TensorFlow Inference library under\n  `contrib/android/cmake`\n- Android: Much more robust Session initialization code.\n- Android: TF stats now exposed directly in demo and log when debug mode is\n  active\n- Android: new/better README.md documentation\n- saved_model is available as `tf.saved_model`.\n- Empty op is now stateful.\n- Improve speed of scatter_update on the cpu for ASSIGN operations.\n- Change `reduce_join` to treat `reduction_indices` in the same way as other `reduce_` ops.\n- Move `TensorForestEstimator` to `contrib/tensor_forest`.\n- Enable compiler optimizations by default and allow configuration in configure.\n- `tf.divide` now honors the name field.\n- Make metrics weight broadcasting more strict.\n- Add new queue-like `StagingArea` and new ops: `stage` and `unstage`.\n\n## Thanks to our Contributors\n\nThis release contains contributions from many people at Google, as well as:\n\nAaron Hu, Abhishek Aggarwal, Adam Michael, Adriano Carmezim, @AfirSraftGarrier,\nAlexander Novikov, Alexander Rosenberg Johansen, Andrew Gibiansky, Andrew Hundt,\nAnish Shah, Anton Loss, @b0noI, @BoyuanJiang, Carl Thomé, Chad Kennedy, Comic\nChang, Connor Braa, Daniel N.

In particular we now match NumPy order as `tf.concat(values, axis, name)`.\n- `tf.image.decode_jpeg` by default uses the faster DCT method, sacrificing\n  a little fidelity for improved speed. One can revert to the old\n  behavior by specifying the attribute `dct_method='INTEGER_ACCURATE'`.\n- `tf.complex_abs` has been removed from the Python interface. `tf.abs`\n  supports complex tensors and should be used instead.\n- Template.`var_scope` property renamed to `.variable_scope`\n- SyncReplicasOptimizer is removed and SyncReplicasOptimizerV2 renamed to SyncReplicasOptimizer.\n- `tf.zeros_initializer()` and `tf.ones_initializer()` now return a callable\n  that must be called with initializer arguments, in your code replace\n  `tf.zeros_initializer` with `tf.zeros_initializer()`.\n- `SparseTensor.shape` has been renamed to `SparseTensor.dense_shape`.  Same for\n  `SparseTensorValue.shape`.\n- Replace tf.scalar_summary, tf.histogram_summary, tf.audio_summary, tf.image_summary with tf.summary.scalar, tf.summary.histogram, tf.summary.audio, tf.summary.image, respectively. The new summary ops take name rather than tag as their first argument, meaning summary ops now respect TensorFlow name scopes.\n- Replace tf.train.SummaryWriter and tf.train.SummaryWriterCache with tf.summary.FileWriter and tf.summary.FileWriterCache. \n- Removes RegisterShape from public API. Use C++ shape function registration\n  instead.\n- Deprecated `_ref` dtypes from the python API.\n- In the C++ API (in tensorflow/cc), Input, Output, etc. have moved\n  from the tensorflow::ops namespace to tensorflow.\n- Change arg order for `{softmax,sparse_softmax,sigmoid}_cross_entropy_with_logits` to be (labels, predictions), and force use of named args.\n\n## Bug Fixes and Other Changes\n- New op: `parallel_stack`.\n- Introducing common tf io compression options constants for\n  RecordReader/RecordWriter.\n- Add `sparse_column_with_vocabulary_file`, to specify a feature column that\n  transform string features to IDs, where the mapping is defined by a vocabulary\n  file.\n- Added `index_to_string_table` which returns a lookup table that maps indices to\n  strings.\n- Add `string_to_index_table`, which returns a lookup table that matches strings\n  to indices.\n- Add a `ParallelForWithWorkerId` function.\n- Add `string_to_index_table`, which returns a lookup table that matches strings\n  to indices.\n- Support restore session from checkpoint files in v2 in `contrib/session_bundle`.\n- Added a tf.contrib.image.rotate function for arbitrary angles.\n- Added `tf.contrib.framework.filter_variables` as a convenience function to\n  filter lists of variables based on regular expressions.\n- `make_template()` takes an optional `custom_getter_ param`.\n- Added comment about how existing directories are handled by\n  `recursive_create_dir`.\n- Added an op for QR factorizations.\n- Divides and mods in Python API now use flooring (Python) semantics.\n- Android: pre-built libs are now built nightly.\n- Android: cmake/gradle build for TensorFlow Inference library under\n  `contrib/android/cmake`\n- Android: Much more robust Session initialization code.\n- Android: TF stats now exposed directly in demo and log when debug mode is\n  active\n- Android: new/better README.md documentation\n- saved_model is available as `tf.saved_model`.\n- Empty op is now stateful.\n- Improve speed of scatter_update on the cpu for ASSIGN operations.\n- Change `reduce_join` to treat `reduction_indices` in the same way as other `reduce_` ops.\n- Move `TensorForestEstimator` to `contrib/tensor_forest`.\n- Enable compiler optimizations by default and allow configuration in configure.\n- `tf.divide` now honors the name field.\n- Make metrics weight broadcasting more strict.\n- Add new queue-like `StagingArea` and new ops: `stage` and `unstage`.\n\n## Thanks to our Contributors\n\nThis release contains contributions from many people at Google, as well as:\n\nAaron Hu, Abhishek Aggarwal, Adam Michael, Adriano Carmezim, @AfirSraftGarrier,\nAlexander Novikov, Alexander Rosenberg Johansen, Andrew Gibiansky, Andrew Hundt,\nAnish Shah, Anton Loss, @b0noI, @BoyuanJiang, Carl Thomé, Chad Kennedy, Comic\nChang, Connor Braa, Daniel N.

    "body": "## Major Features and Improvements\n- TensorFlow Debugger (tfdbg): command-line interface and API.\n- New python 3 docker images added.\n- Made pip packages pypi compliant. TensorFlow can now be installed by `pip\n  install tensorflow` command.\n- Android: person detection + tracking demo implementing Scalable Object\n  Detection using Deep Neural Networks.\n- Android: pre-built libs are now built nightly.\n- New (experimental) [Java API](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tensorflow/java).\n\n## Breaking Changes to the API\n- TensorFlow/models have been moved to a separate github repository.\n- Division and modulus operators (/, //, %) now match Python (flooring)\n  semantics. This applies to `tf.div` and `tf.mod` as well. To obtain forced\n  integer truncation based behaviors you can use `tf.truncatediv`\n  and `tf.truncatemod`.\n- `tf.divide()` is now the recommended division function. `tf.div()` will\n  remain, but its semantics do not respond to Python 3 or `from future`\n  mechanisms.\n- tf.reverse() now takes indices of axes to be reversed. E.g.\n  `tf.reverse(a, [True, False, True])` must now be written as\n  `tf.reverse(a, [0, 2])`. `tf.reverse_v2()` will remain until 1.0 final.\n- `tf.mul`, `tf.sub` and `tf.neg` are deprecated in favor of `tf.multiply`,\n  `tf.subtract` and `tf.negative`.\n- `tf.pack` and `tf.unpack` are deprecated in favor of `tf.stack` and\n  `tf.unstack`.\n- `TensorArray.pack` and `TensorArray.unpack` are getting deprecated in favor of\n  `TensorArray.stack` and `TensorArray.unstack`.\n- The following Python functions have had their arguments changed to use `axis`\n  when referring to specific dimensions. We have kept the old keyword arguments\n  for compatibility currently, but we will be removing them well before the\n  final 1.0.\n  - `tf.argmax`: `dimension` becomes `axis`\n  - `tf.argmin`: `dimension` becomes `axis`\n  - `tf.count_nonzero`: `reduction_indices` becomes `axis`\n  - `tf.expand_dims`: `dim` becomes `axis`\n  - `tf.reduce_all`: `reduction_indices` becomes `axis`\n  - `tf.reduce_any`: `reduction_indices` becomes `axis`\n  - `tf.reduce_join`: `reduction_indices` becomes `axis`\n  - `tf.reduce_logsumexp`: `reduction_indices` becomes `axis`\n  - `tf.reduce_max`: `reduction_indices` becomes `axis`\n  - `tf.reduce_mean`: `reduction_indices` becomes `axis`\n  - `tf.reduce_min`: `reduction_indices` becomes `axis`\n  - `tf.reduce_prod`: `reduction_indices` becomes `axis`\n  - `tf.reduce_sum`: `reduction_indices` becomes `axis`\n  - `tf.reverse_sequence`: `batch_dim` becomes `batch_axis`, `seq_dim` becomes `seq_axis`\n  - `tf.sparse_concat`: `concat_dim` becomes `axis`\n  - `tf.sparse_reduce_sum`: `reduction_axes` becomes `axis`\n  - `tf.sparse_reduce_sum_sparse`: `reduction_axes` becomes `axis`\n  - `tf.sparse_split`: `split_dim` becomes `axis`\n- `tf.listdiff` has been renamed to `tf.setdiff1d` to match NumPy naming.\n- `tf.inv` has been renamed to be `tf.reciprocal` (component-wise reciprocal)\n  to avoid confusion with `np.inv` which is matrix inversion\n- tf.round now uses banker's rounding (round to even) semantics to match NumPy.\n- `tf.split` now takes arguments in a reversed order and with different\n  keywords. In particular, we now match NumPy order as\n  `tf.split(value, num_or_size_splits, axis)`.\n- `tf.sparse_split` now takes arguments in reversed order and with different\n  keywords. In particular we now match NumPy order as\n  `tf.sparse_split(sp_input, num_split, axis)`. NOTE: we have temporarily\n  made `tf.sparse_split` require keyword arguments.\n- Deprecated `tf.concat` operator. Please switch to use `tf.concat_v2` for now.\n  In the Beta release, we will update `tf.concat` to match argument order of\n  `tf.concat_v2`.\n- `tf.image.decode_jpeg` by default uses the faster DCT method, sacrificing\n  a little fidelity for improved speed. One can revert to the old\n  behavior by specifying the attribute `dct_method='INTEGER_ACCURATE'`.\n- `tf.complex_abs` has been removed from the Python interface. `tf.abs`\n  supports complex tensors and should be used instead.\n- Template.`var_scope` property renamed to `.variable_scope`\n- SyncReplicasOptimizer is removed and SyncReplicasOptimizerV2 renamed to SyncReplicasOptimizer.\n- `tf.zeros_initializer()` and `tf.ones_initializer()` now return a callable\n  that must be called with initializer arguments, in your code replace\n  `tf.zeros_initializer` with `tf.zeros_initializer()`.\n- `SparseTensor.shape` has been renamed to `SparseTensor.dense_shape`.  Same for\n  `SparseTensorValue.shape`.\n- Remove old tf summary ops, like `tf.scalar_summary` and `tf.histogram_summary`.\n  Use `tf.summary.scalar` and `tf.summary.histogram` instead.\n- Remove tf.train.SummaryWriter and tf.train.SummaryWriterCache.\n- Removes RegisterShape from public API. Use C++ shape function registration\n  instead.\n- Deprecated `_ref` dtypes from the python API.\n\n## Bug Fixes and Other Changes\n- New op: `parallel_stack`.\n- Introducing common tf io compression options constants for\n  RecordReader/RecordWriter.\n- Add `sparse_column_with_vocabulary_file`, to specify a feature column that\n  transform string features to IDs, where the mapping is defined by a vocabulary\n  file.\n- Added `index_to_string_table` which returns a lookup table that maps indices to\n  strings.\n- Add `string_to_index_table`, which returns a lookup table that matches strings\n  to indices.\n- Add a `ParallelForWithWorkerId` function.\n- Add `string_to_index_table`, which returns a lookup table that matches strings\n  to indices.\n- Support restore session from checkpoint files in v2 in `contrib/session_bundle`.\n- Added a tf.contrib.image.rotate function for arbitrary angles.\n- Added `tf.contrib.framework.filter_variables` as a convenience function to\n  filter lists of variables based on regular expressions.\n- Remove old tf summary ops, like `tf.scalar_summary` and `tf.histogram_summary`.\n  Use `tf.summary.scalar` and `tf.summary.histogram` instead.\n- `make_template()` takes an optional `custom_getter_ param`.\n- Added comment about how existing directories are handled by\n  `recursive_create_dir`.\n- Added an op for QR factorizations.\n- Divides and mods in Python API now use flooring (Python) semantics.\n- Android: cmake/gradle build for TensorFlow Inference library under\n  `contrib/android/cmake`\n- Android: Much more robust Session initialization code.\n- Android: TF stats now exposed directly in demo and log when debug mode is\n  active\n- Android: new/better README.md documentation\n\n## Thanks to our Contributors\n\nThis release contains contributions from many people at Google, as well as:\n\nAaron Hu, Abhishek Aggarwal, Adam Michael, Adriano Carmezim, @AfirSraftGarrier,\nAlexander Novikov, Alexander Rosenberg Johansen, Andrew Gibiansky, Andrew Hundt,\nAnish Shah, Anton Loss, @b0noI, @BoyuanJiang, Carl Thomé, Chad Kennedy, Comic\nChang, Connor Braa, Daniel N.

    "body": "# Release 1.4.0\r\n\r\n## Major Features And Improvements\r\n* `tf.keras` is now part of the core TensorFlow API.\r\n* [`tf.data`](http://tensorflow.org/programmers_guide/datasets) is now part of\r\n  the core TensorFlow API.\r\n  * The API is now subject to backwards compatibility guarantees.\r\n  * For a guide to migrating from the `tf.contrib.data` API, see the\r\n    [README](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/r1.4/tensorflow/contrib/data/README.md).\r\n  * Major new features include `Dataset.from_generator()` (for building an input\r\n    pipeline from a Python generator), and the `Dataset.apply()` method for\r\n    applying custom transformation functions.\r\n  * Several custom transformation functions have been added, including\r\n    `tf.contrib.data.batch_and_drop_remainder()` and\r\n    `tf.contrib.data.sloppy_interleave()`.\r\n* Add `train_and_evaluate` for simple distributed `Estimator` training.\r\n* Add `tf.spectral.dct` for computing the DCT-II.\r\n* Add Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficient support to `tf.contrib.signal`\r\n  (with GPU and gradient support).\r\n* Add a self-check on `import tensorflow` for Windows DLL issues.\r\n* Add NCHW support to `tf.depth_to_space` on GPU.\r\n* TensorFlow Debugger (tfdbg):\r\n  * Add `eval` command to allow evaluation of arbitrary Python/numpy expressions\r\n    in tfdbg command-line interface. See\r\n    [Debugging TensorFlow Programs](https://www.tensorflow.org/programmers_guide/debugger)\r\n    for more details.\r\n  * Usability improvement: The frequently used tensor filter `has_inf_or_nan` is\r\n    now added to `Session` wrappers and hooks by default. So there is no need\r\n    for clients to call `.add_tensor_filter(tf_debug.has_inf_or_nan)` anymore.\r\n* SinhArcsinh (scalar) distribution added to `contrib.distributions`.\r\n* Make `GANEstimator` opensource.\r\n* `Estimator.export_savedmodel()` now includes all valid serving signatures\r\n  that can be constructed from the Serving Input Receiver and all available\r\n  ExportOutputs. For instance, a classifier may provide regression- and\r\n  prediction-flavored outputs, in addition to the classification-flavored one.\r\n  Building signatures from these allows TF Serving to honor requests using the\r\n  different APIs (Classify, Regress, and Predict). Furthermore,\r\n  `serving_input_receiver_fn()` may now specify alternative subsets of nodes\r\n  that may act as inputs. This allows, for instance, producing a prediction\r\n  signature for a classifier that accepts raw `Tensors` instead of a serialized\r\n  `tf.Example`.\r\n* Add `tf.contrib.bayesflow.hmc`.\r\n* Add `tf.contrib.distributions.MixtureSameFamily`.\r\n* Make `Dataset.shuffle()` always reshuffles after each iteration by default.\r\n* Add `tf.contrib.bayesflow.metropolis_hastings`.\r\n* Add `log_rate` parameter to `tf.contrib.distributions.Poisson`.\r\n* Extend `tf.contrib.distributions.bijector` API to handle some non-injective\r\n  transforms.\r\n* Java:\r\n  * Generics (e.g., `Tensor<Integer>`) for improved type-safety\r\n    (courtesy @andrewcmyers).\r\n  * Support for multi-dimensional string tensors.\r\n  * Support loading of custom operations (e.g. many in `tf.contrib`) on Linux\r\n    and OS X\r\n* All our prebuilt binaries have been built with CUDA 8 and cuDNN 6.\r\n  We anticipate releasing TensorFlow 1.5 with CUDA 9 and cuDNN 7.\r\n\r\n## Bug Fixes and Other Changes\r\n* `tf.nn.rnn_cell.DropoutWrapper` is now more careful about dropping out LSTM\r\n  states.  Specifically, it no longer ever drops the `c` (memory) state of an\r\n  `LSTMStateTuple`.  The new behavior leads to proper dropout behavior\r\n  for LSTMs and stacked LSTMs.  This bug fix follows recommendations from\r\n  published literature, but is a behavioral change.  State dropout behavior\r\n  may be customized via the new `dropout_state_filter_visitor` argument.\r\n* Removed `tf.contrib.training.python_input`.  The same behavior, in a more\r\n  flexible and reproducible package, is available via the new\r\n  `tf.contrib.data.Dataset.from_generator` method!\r\n* Fix `tf.contrib.distributions.Affine` incorrectly computing log-det-jacobian.\r\n* Fix `tf.random_gamma` incorrectly handling non-batch, scalar draws.\r\n* Resolved a race condition in TensorForest TreePredictionsV4Op.\r\n* Google Cloud Storage file system, Amazon S3 file system, and Hadoop file\r\n  system support are now default build options.\r\n* Custom op libraries must link against libtensorflow_framework.so\r\n  (installed at `tf.sysconfig.get_lib()`).\r\n* Change `RunConfig` default behavior to not set a random seed, making random\r\n  behavior independently random on distributed workers. We expect this to\r\n  generally improve training performance. Models that do rely on determinism\r\n  should set a random seed explicitly.\r\n\r\n## Breaking Changes to the API\r\n* The signature of the `tf.contrib.data.rejection_resample()` function has been\r\n  changed. It now returns a function that can be used as an argument to\r\n  `Dataset.apply()`.\r\n* Remove `tf.contrib.data.Iterator.from_dataset()` method. Use\r\n  `Dataset.make_initializable_iterator()` instead.\r\n* Remove seldom used and unnecessary `tf.contrib.data.Iterator.dispose_op()`.\r\n* Reorder some TFGAN loss functions in a non-backwards compatible way.\r\n\r\n## Known Issues\r\n* In Python 3, `Dataset.from_generator()` does not support Unicode strings.\r\n  You must convert any strings to bytes objects before yielding them from\r\n  the generator.\r\n\r\n## Thanks to our Contributors\r\n\r\nThis release contains contributions from many people at Google, as well as:\r\n\r\n4d55397500, Abdullah Alrasheed, abenmao, Adam Salvail, Aditya Dhulipala, Ag Ramesh,\r\nAkimasa Kimura, Alan Du, Alan Yee, Alexander, Amit Kushwaha, Amy, Andrei Costinescu,\r\nAndrei Nigmatulin, Andrew Erlichson, Andrew Myers, Andrew Stepanov, Androbin, AngryPowman,\r\nAnish Shah, Anton Daitche, Artsiom Chapialiou, asdf2014, Aseem Raj Baranwal, Ash Hall,\r\nBart Kiers, Batchu Venkat Vishal, ben, Ben Barsdell, Bill Piel, Carl Thomé, Catalin Voss,\r\nChangming Sun, Chengzhi Chen, Chi Zeng, Chris Antaki, Chris Donahue, Chris Oelmueller,\r\nChris Tava, Clayne Robison, Codrut, Courtial Florian, Dalmo Cirne, Dan J, Darren Garvey,\r\nDavid Kristoffersson, David Norman, David RöThlisberger, DavidNorman, Dhruv, DimanNe,\r\nDorokhov, Duncan Mac-Vicar P, EdwardDixon, EMCP, error.d, FAIJUL, Fan Xia,\r\nFrancois Xavier, Fred Reiss, Freedom\" Koan-Sin Tan, Fritz Obermeyer, Gao, Xiang,\r\nGuenther Schmuelling, Guo Yejun (郭叶军), Hans Gaiser, HectorSVC, Hyungsuk Yoon,\r\nJames Pruegsanusak, Jay Young, Jean Wanka, Jeff Carpenter, Jeremy Rutman, Jeroen BéDorf,\r\nJett Jones, Jimmy Jia, jinghuangintel, jinze1994, JKurland, Joel Hestness, joetoth,\r\nJohn B Nelson, John Impallomeni, John Lawson, Jonas, Jonathan Dekhtiar, joshkyh, Jun Luan,\r\nJun Mei, Kai Sasaki, Karl Lessard, karl@kubx.ca, Kb Sriram, Kenichi Ueno, Kevin Slagle,\r\nKongsea, Lakshay Garg, lhlmgr, Lin Min, liu.guangcong, Loki Der Quaeler, Louie Helm,\r\nlucasmoura, Luke Iwanski, Lyndon White, Mahmoud Abuzaina, Marcel Puyat, Mark Aaron Shirley,\r\nMichele Colombo, MtDersvan, Namrata-Ibm, Nathan Luehr, Naurril, Nayana Thorat, Nicolas Lopez,\r\nNiranjan Hasabnis, Nolan Liu, Nouce, Oliver Hennigh, osdamv, Patrik Erdes,\r\nPatryk Chrabaszcz, Pavel Christof, Penghao Cen, postBG, Qingqing Cao, Qingying Chen, qjivy,\r\nRaphael, Rasmi, raymondxyang, Renze Yu, resec, Roffel, Ruben Vereecken, Ryohei Kuroki,\r\nsandipmgiri, Santiago Castro, Scott Kirkland, Sean Vig, Sebastian Raschka, Sebastian Weiss,\r\nSergey Kolesnikov, Sergii Khomenko, Shahid, Shivam Kotwalia, Stuart Berg, Sumit Gouthaman,\r\nsuperzerg, Sven Mayer, tetris, Ti Zhou, Tiago Freitas Pereira, Tian Jin, Tomoaki Oiki,\r\nVaibhav Sood, vfdev, Vivek Rane, Vladimir Moskva, wangqr, Weber Xie, Will Frey,\r\nYan Facai (颜发才), yanivbl6, Yaroslav Bulatov, Yixing Lao, Yong Tang, youkaichao,\r\nYuan (Terry) Tang, Yue Zhang, Yuxin Wu, Ziming Dong, ZxYuan, 黄璞\r\n\r\nWe are also grateful to all who filed issues or helped resolve them, asked and\r\nanswered questions, and were part of inspiring discussions."

Models that do rely on determinism\r\n  should set a random seed explicitly.\r\n\r\n## Breaking Changes to the API\r\n* The signature of the `tf.contrib.data.rejection_resample()` function has been\r\n  changed. It now returns a function that can be used as an argument to\r\n  `Dataset.apply()`.\r\n* Remove `tf.contrib.data.Iterator.from_dataset()` method. Use\r\n  `Dataset.make_initializable_iterator()` instead.\r\n* Remove seldom used and unnecessary `tf.contrib.data.Iterator.dispose_op()`.\r\n* Reorder some TFGAN loss functions in a non-backwards compatible way.\r\n\r\n## Known Issues\r\n* In Python 3, `Dataset.from_generator()` does not support Unicode strings.\r\n  You must convert any strings to bytes objects before yielding them from\r\n  the generator.\r\n\r\n## Thanks to our Contributors\r\n\r\nThis release contains contributions from many people at Google, as well as:\r\n\r\n4d55397500, Abdullah Alrasheed, abenmao, Adam Salvail, Aditya Dhulipala, Ag Ramesh,\r\nAkimasa Kimura, Alan Du, Alan Yee, Alexander, Amit Kushwaha, Amy, Andrei Costinescu,\r\nAndrei Nigmatulin, Andrew Erlichson, Andrew Myers, Andrew Stepanov, Androbin, AngryPowman,\r\nAnish Shah, Anton Daitche, Artsiom Chapialiou, asdf2014, Aseem Raj Baranwal, Ash Hall,\r\nBart Kiers, Batchu Venkat Vishal, ben, Ben Barsdell, Bill Piel, Carl Thomé, Catalin Voss,\r\nChangming Sun, Chengzhi Chen, Chi Zeng, Chris Antaki, Chris Donahue, Chris Oelmueller,\r\nChris Tava, Clayne Robison, Codrut, Courtial Florian, Dalmo Cirne, Dan J, Darren Garvey,\r\nDavid Kristoffersson, David Norman, David RöThlisberger, DavidNorman, Dhruv, DimanNe,\r\nDorokhov, Duncan Mac-Vicar P, EdwardDixon, EMCP, error.d, FAIJUL, Fan Xia,\r\nFrancois Xavier, Fred Reiss, Freedom\" Koan-Sin Tan, Fritz Obermeyer, Gao, Xiang,\r\nGuenther Schmuelling, Guo Yejun (郭叶军), Hans Gaiser, HectorSVC, Hyungsuk Yoon,\r\nJames Pruegsanusak, Jay Young, Jean Wanka, Jeff Carpenter, Jeremy Rutman, Jeroen BéDorf,\r\nJett Jones, Jimmy Jia, jinghuangintel, jinze1994, JKurland, Joel Hestness, joetoth,\r\nJohn B Nelson, John Impallomeni, John Lawson, Jonas, Jonathan Dekhtiar, joshkyh, Jun Luan,\r\nJun Mei, Kai Sasaki, Karl Lessard, karl@kubx.ca, Kb Sriram, Kenichi Ueno, Kevin Slagle,\r\nKongsea, Lakshay Garg, lhlmgr, Lin Min, liu.guangcong, Loki Der Quaeler, Louie Helm,\r\nlucasmoura, Luke Iwanski, Lyndon White, Mahmoud Abuzaina, Marcel Puyat, Mark Aaron Shirley,\r\nMichele Colombo, MtDersvan, Namrata-Ibm, Nathan Luehr, Naurril, Nayana Thorat, Nicolas Lopez,\r\nNiranjan Hasabnis, Nolan Liu, Nouce, Oliver Hennigh, osdamv, Patrik Erdes,\r\nPatryk Chrabaszcz, Pavel Christof, Penghao Cen, postBG, Qingqing Cao, Qingying Chen, qjivy,\r\nRaphael, Rasmi, raymondxyang, Renze Yu, resec, Roffel, Ruben Vereecken, Ryohei Kuroki,\r\nsandipmgiri, Santiago Castro, Scott Kirkland, Sean Vig, Sebastian Raschka, Sebastian Weiss,\r\nSergey Kolesnikov, Sergii Khomenko, Shahid, Shivam Kotwalia, Stuart Berg, Sumit Gouthaman,\r\nsuperzerg, Sven Mayer, tetris, Ti Zhou, Tiago Freitas Pereira, Tian Jin, Tomoaki Oiki,\r\nVaibhav Sood, vfdev, Vivek Rane, Vladimir Moskva, wangqr, Weber Xie, Will Frey,\r\nYan Facai (颜发才), yanivbl6, Yaroslav Bulatov, Yixing Lao, Yong Tang, youkaichao,\r\nYuan (Terry) Tang, Yue Zhang, Yuxin Wu, Ziming Dong, ZxYuan, 黄璞\r\n\r\nWe are also grateful to all who filed issues or helped resolve them, asked and\r\nanswered questions, and were part of inspiring discussions."

    "body": "# Release 1.4.0\r\n\r\n## Major Features And Improvements\r\n* `tf.data` is now part of the core TensorFlow API.\r\n  * The API is now subject to backwards compatibility guarantees.\r\n  * For a guide to migrating from the `tf.contrib.data` API, see the\r\n    [README](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/r1.4/tensorflow/contrib/data/README.md).\r\n  * Major new features include `Dataset.from_generator()` (for building an input\r\n    pipeline from a Python generator), and the `Dataset.apply()` method for\r\n    applying custom transformation functions.\r\n  * Several custom transformation functions have been added, including\r\n    `tf.contrib.data.batch_and_drop_remainder()` and\r\n    `tf.contrib.data.sloppy_interleave()`.\r\n* Add `train_and_evaluate` for simple distributed `Estimator` training.\r\n* Add `tf.spectral.dct` for computing the DCT-II.\r\n* Add Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficient support to `tf.contrib.signal`\r\n  (with GPU and gradient support).\r\n* Add a self-check on `import tensorflow` for Windows DLL issues.\r\n* Add NCHW support to `tf.depth_to_space` on GPU.\r\n* SinhArcsinh (scalar) distribution added to `contrib.distributions`.\r\n* Make `GANEstimator` opensource.\r\n* `Estimator.export_savedmodel()` now includes all valid serving signatures\r\n  that can be constructed from the Serving Input Receiver and all available\r\n  ExportOutputs. For instance, a classifier may provide regression- and\r\n  prediction-flavored outputs, in addition to the classification-flavored one.\r\n  Building signatures from these allows TF Serving to honor requests using the\r\n  different APIs (Classify, Regress, and Predict). Furthermore,\r\n  `serving_input_receiver_fn()` may now specify alternative subsets of nodes\r\n  that may act as inputs. This allows, for instance, producing a prediction\r\n  signature for a classifier that accepts raw `Tensors` instead of a serialized\r\n  `tf.Example`.\r\n* Add `tf.contrib.bayesflow.hmc`.\r\n* Add `tf.contrib.distributions.MixtureSameFamily`.\r\n* Make `Dataset.shuffle()` always reshuffles after each iteration by default.\r\n* Add `tf.contrib.bayesflow.metropolis_hastings`.\r\n* Add `log_rate` parameter to `tf.contrib.distributions.Poisson`.\r\n* Extend `tf.contrib.distributions.bijector` API to handle some non-injective\r\n  transforms.\r\n* Java:\r\n  * Generics (e.g., `Tensor<Integer>`) for improved type-safety\r\n    (courtesy @andrewcmyers).\r\n  * Support for multi-dimensional string tensors.\r\n  * Support loading of custom operations (e.g. many in `tf.contrib`) on Linux\r\n    and OS X\r\n\r\n## Bug Fixes and Other Changes\r\n* `tf.nn.rnn_cell.DropoutWrapper` is now more careful about dropping out LSTM\r\n  states.  Specifically, it no longer ever drops the `c` (memory) state of an\r\n  `LSTMStateTuple`.  The new behavior leads to proper dropout behavior\r\n  for LSTMs and stacked LSTMs.  This bug fix follows recommendations from\r\n  published literature, but is a behavioral change.  State dropout behavior\r\n  may be customized via the new `dropout_state_filter_visitor` argument.\r\n* Removed `tf.contrib.training.python_input`.  The same behavior, in a more\r\n  flexible and reproducible package, is available via the new\r\n  `tf.contrib.data.Dataset.from_generator` method!\r\n* Fix `tf.contrib.distributions.Affine` incorrectly computing log-det-jacobian.\r\n* Fix `tf.random_gamma` incorrectly handling non-batch, scalar draws.\r\n* Resolved a race condition in TensorForest TreePredictionsV4Op.\r\n* Google Cloud Storage file system and Hadoop file system support are now\r\n  default build options.\r\n\r\n## Breaking Changes to the API\r\n* The signature of the `tf.contrib.data.rejection_resample()` function has been\r\n  changed. It now returns a function that can be used as an argument to\r\n  `Dataset.apply()`.\r\n* Remove `tf.contrib.data.Iterator.from_dataset()` method. Use\r\n  `Dataset.make_initializable_iterator()` instead.\r\n* Remove seldom used and unnecessary `tf.contrib.data.Iterator.dispose_op()`.\r\n* Reorder some TFGAN loss functions in a non-backwards compatible way.\r\n\r\n## Thanks to our Contributors\r\n\r\nThis release contains contributions from many people at Google, as well as:\r\n\r\n4d55397500, Abdullah Alrasheed, abenmao, Adam Salvail, Aditya Dhulipala, Ag Ramesh,\r\nAkimasa Kimura, Alan Du, Alan Yee, Alexander, Amit Kushwaha, Amy, Andrei Costinescu,\r\nAndrei Nigmatulin, Andrew Erlichson, Andrew Myers, Andrew Stepanov, Androbin, AngryPowman,\r\nAnish Shah, Anton Daitche, Artsiom Chapialiou, asdf2014, Aseem Raj Baranwal, Ash Hall,\r\nBart Kiers, Batchu Venkat Vishal, ben, Ben Barsdell, Bill Piel, Carl Thomé, Catalin Voss,\r\nChangming Sun, Chengzhi Chen, Chi Zeng, Chris Antaki, Chris Donahue, Chris Oelmueller,\r\nChris Tava, Clayne Robison, Codrut, Courtial Florian, Dalmo Cirne, Dan J, Darren Garvey,\r\nDavid Kristoffersson, David Norman, David RöThlisberger, DavidNorman, Dhruv, DimanNe,\r\nDorokhov, Duncan Mac-Vicar P, EdwardDixon, EMCP, error.d, FAIJUL, Fan Xia,\r\nFrancois Xavier, Fred Reiss, Freedom\" Koan-Sin Tan, Fritz Obermeyer, Gao, Xiang,\r\nGuenther Schmuelling, Guo Yejun (郭叶军), Hans Gaiser, HectorSVC, Hyungsuk Yoon,\r\nJames Pruegsanusak, Jay Young, Jean Wanka, Jeff Carpenter, Jeremy Rutman, Jeroen BéDorf,\r\nJett Jones, Jimmy Jia, jinghuangintel, jinze1994, JKurland, Joel Hestness, joetoth,\r\nJohn B Nelson, John Impallomeni, John Lawson, Jonas, Jonathan Dekhtiar, joshkyh, Jun Luan,\r\nJun Mei, Kai Sasaki, Karl Lessard, karl@kubx.ca, Kb Sriram, Kenichi Ueno, Kevin Slagle,\r\nKongsea, Lakshay Garg, lhlmgr, Lin Min, liu.guangcong, Loki Der Quaeler, Louie Helm,\r\nlucasmoura, Luke Iwanski, Lyndon White, Mahmoud Abuzaina, Marcel Puyat, Mark Aaron Shirley,\r\nMichele Colombo, MtDersvan, Namrata-Ibm, Nathan Luehr, Naurril, Nayana Thorat, Nicolas Lopez,\r\nNiranjan Hasabnis, Nolan Liu, Nouce, Oliver Hennigh, osdamv, Patrik Erdes,\r\nPatryk Chrabaszcz, Pavel Christof, Penghao Cen, postBG, Qingqing Cao, Qingying Chen, qjivy,\r\nRaphael, Rasmi, raymondxyang, Renze Yu, resec, Roffel, Ruben Vereecken, Ryohei Kuroki,\r\nsandipmgiri, Santiago Castro, Scott Kirkland, Sean Vig, Sebastian Raschka, Sebastian Weiss,\r\nSergey Kolesnikov, Sergii Khomenko, Shahid, Shivam Kotwalia, Stuart Berg, Sumit Gouthaman,\r\nsuperzerg, Sven Mayer, tetris, Ti Zhou, Tiago Freitas Pereira, Tian Jin, Tomoaki Oiki,\r\nVaibhav Sood, vfdev, Vivek Rane, Vladimir Moskva, wangqr, Weber Xie, Will Frey,\r\nYan Facai (颜发才), yanivbl6, Yaroslav Bulatov, Yixing Lao, Yong Tang, youkaichao,\r\nYuan (Terry) Tang, Yue Zhang, Yuxin Wu, Ziming Dong, ZxYuan, 黄璞\r\n\r\nWe are also grateful to all who filed issues or helped resolve them, asked and\r\nanswered questions, and were part of inspiring discussions."

List of added estimators:\r\n  * `DNNClassifier`\r\n  * `DNNRegressor`\r\n  * `LinearClassifier`\r\n  * `LinearRegressor`\r\n  * `DNNLinearCombinedClassifier`\r\n  * `DNNLinearCombinedRegressor`.\r\n* All our prebuilt binaries have been built with cuDNN 6. We anticipate releasing TensorFlow 1.4 with cuDNN 7.\r\n* `import tensorflow` now goes much faster.\r\n* Adds a file cache to the GCS filesystem with configurable max staleness for file contents. This permits caching of file contents across close/open boundaries.\r\n* Added an axis parameter to `tf.gather`.\r\n* Added a `constant_values` keyword argument to `tf.pad`.\r\n* Adds `Dataset.interleave` transformation.\r\n* Add `ConcatenateDataset` to concatenate two datasets.\r\n* Added Mobilenet support to TensorFlow for Poets training script.\r\n* Adds a block cache to the GCS filesystem with configurable block size and count.\r\n* SinhArcSinh bijector added.\r\n* Added `Dataset.list_files` API.\r\n* Introduces new operations and Python bindings for the Cloud TPU.\r\n* Adding TensorFlow-iOS CocoaPod for symmetry with tensorflow-android.\r\n* Introduces base implementations of ClusterResolvers.\r\n* Unify memory representations of TensorShape and PartialTensorShape. As a consequence, tensors now have a maximum of 254 dimensions, not 255.\r\n* Changed references to LIBXSMM to use version 1.8.1.\r\n* TensorFlow Debugger (tfdbg):\r\n  * Display summaries of numeric tensor values with the `-s` flag to command `print_tensor` or `pt`.\r\n  * Display feed values with the `print_feed` or `pf` command and clickable links in the curses UI.\r\n  * Runtime profiler at the op level and the Python source line level with the `run -p` command.\r\n* Initial release of the statistical distribution library `tf.distributions`.\r\n* GPU kernels and speed improvements for for unary `tf.where` and `tf.nn.top_k`.\r\n* Monotonic Attention wrappers added to `tf.contrib.seq2seq`.\r\n* Added `tf.contrib.signal`, a library for signal processing primitives.\r\n* Added `tf.contrib.resampler`, containing CPU and GPU ops for differentiable resampling of images.\r\n\r\n## Breaking Changes to the API\r\n* `tf.RewriterConfig` was removed from the Python API after being available in 1.2 release candidates (it was never in an actual release). Graph rewriting is still available, just not as `tf.RewriterConfig`. Instead add an explicit import.\r\n* Breaking change to `tf.contrib.data.Dataset` APIs that expect a nested structure. Lists are now converted to `tf.Tensor` implicitly. You may need to change uses of lists to tuples in existing code. In addition, dicts are now supported as a nested structure.\r\n\r\n## Changes to contrib APIs\r\n* Adds tf.contrib.nn.rank_sampled_softmax_loss, a sampled-softmax variant that can improve rank loss.\r\n* `tf.contrib.metrics`.{streaming_covariance,streaming_pearson_correlation} modified to return nan when they have seen less or equal to 1 unit of weight.\r\n* Adds time series models to contrib. See contrib/timeseries/README.md for details.\r\n* Adds FULLY_CONNECTED Op to tensorflow/contrib/lite/schema.fbs\r\n\r\n## Known Issues\r\n* Tensorflow_gpu compilation fails with Bazel 0.5.3.\r\n\r\n## Bug Fixes and Other Changes\r\n* Fixes `strides` and `begin` dtype mismatch when slicing using int64 Tensor index in python.\r\n* Improved convolution padding documentation.\r\n* Add a tag constant, gpu, to present graph with GPU support.\r\n* `saved_model.utils` now support SparseTensors transparently.\r\n* A more efficient implementation of non-max suppression.\r\n* Add support for the shrinkage-type L2 to FtrlOptimizer in addition to the online L2 it already supports.\r\n* Fix negative variance in moments calculation.\r\n* Expand UniqueOp Benchmark Tests to cover more collision cases.\r\n* Improves stability of GCS filesystem on Mac.\r\n* Add time estimation to HloCostAnalysis.\r\n* Fixed the bug in Estimator that params in constructor was not a deepcopy of the user provided one. This bugs inadvertently enabled user to mutate the params after the creation of Estimator, leading to potentially undefined behavior.\r\n* Added None check for save_path in `saver.restore`.\r\n* Register devices under their legacy names in device_mgr to ease the transition to clusterspec-propagated configurations.\r\n* VectorExponential added to distributions.\r\n* Add a bitwise module with bitwise_and, bitwise_or, bitwise_xor, and invert functions.\r\n* Add fixed-grid ODE integration routines.\r\n* Allow passing bounds to ScipyOptimizerInterface.\r\n* Correctness fixes for fft_length parameter to `tf.spectral.rfft` & `tf.spectral.irfft`.\r\n* Exported model signatures using the 'predict' method will no longer have their input and output keys silently ignored and rewritten to 'inputs' and 'outputs'. If a model was exported with different names before 1.2, and is now served with tensorflow/serving, it will accept requests using 'inputs' and 'outputs'. Starting at 1.2, such a model will accept the keys specified during export. Therefore, inference requests using 'inputs' and 'outputs' may start to fail. To fix this, either update any inference clients to send requests with the actual input and output keys used by the trainer code, or conversely, update the trainer code to name the input and output Tensors 'inputs' and 'outputs', respectively.

    "body": "# Release 1.3.0\r\n\r\n## Major Features and Improvements\r\n* Added canned estimators to Tensorflow library. List of added estimators:\r\n  * `DNNClassifier`\r\n  * `DNNRegressor`\r\n  * `LinearClassifier`\r\n  * `LinearRegressor`\r\n  * `DNNLinearCombinedClassifier`\r\n  * `DNNLinearCombinedRegressor`.\r\n* All our prebuilt binaries have been built with cuDNN 6.\r\n* `import tensorflow` now goes much faster.\r\n* Adds a file cache to the GCS filesystem with configurable max staleness for file contents. This permits caching of file contents across close/open boundaries.\r\n* Added an axis parameter to `tf.gather`.\r\n* Added a `constant_values` keyword argument to `tf.pad`.\r\n* Adds `Dataset.interleave` transformation.\r\n* Add `ConcatenateDataset` to concatenate two datasets.\r\n* Added Mobilenet support to TensorFlow for Poets training script.\r\n* Adds a block cache to the GCS filesystem with configurable block size and count.\r\n* SinhArcSinh bijector added.\r\n* Added `Dataset.list_files` API.\r\n* Introduces new operations and Python bindings for the Cloud TPU.\r\n* Adding TensorFlow-iOS CocoaPod for symmetry with tensorflow-android.\r\n* Introduces base implementations of ClusterResolvers.\r\n* Unify memory representations of TensorShape and PartialTensorShape. As a consequence, tensors now have a maximum of 254 dimensions, not 255.\r\n* Changed references to LIBXSMM to use version 1.8.1.\r\n* TensorFlow Debugger (tfdbg):\r\n  * Display summaries of numeric tensor values with the `-s` flag to command `print_tensor` or `pt`.\r\n  * Display feed values with the `print_feed` or `pf` command and clickable links in the curses UI.\r\n  * Runtime profiler at the op level and the Python source line level with the `run -p` command.\r\n* Initial release of the statistical distribution library `tf.distributions`.\r\n* GPU kernels and speed improvements for for unary `tf.where` and `tf.nn.top_k`.\r\n* Monotonic Attention wrappers added to `tf.contrib.seq2seq`.\r\n* Added `tf.contrib.signal`, a library for signal processing primitives.\r\n* Added `tf.contrib.resampler`, containing CPU and GPU ops for differentiable resampling of images.\r\n\r\n## Breaking Changes to the API\r\n* `tf.RewriterConfig` was removed from the Python API after being available in 1.2 release candidates (it was never in an actual release). Graph rewriting is still available, just not as `tf.RewriterConfig`. Instead add an explicit import.\r\n* Breaking change to `tf.contrib.data.Dataset` APIs that expect a nested structure. Lists are now converted to `tf.Tensor` implicitly. You may need to change uses of lists to tuples in existing code. In addition, dicts are now supported as a nested structure.\r\n\r\n## Changes to contrib APIs\r\n* Adds tf.contrib.nn.rank_sampled_softmax_loss, a sampled-softmax variant that can improve rank loss.\r\n* `tf.contrib.metrics`.{streaming_covariance,streaming_pearson_correlation} modified to return nan when they have seen less or equal to 1 unit of weight.\r\n* Adds time series models to contrib. See contrib/timeseries/README.md for details.\r\n* Adds FULLY_CONNECTED Op to tensorflow/contrib/lite/schema.fbs\r\n\r\n## Bug Fixes and Other Changes\r\n* Fixes `strides` and `begin` dtype mismatch when slicing using int64 Tensor index in python.\r\n* Improved convolution padding documentation.\r\n* Add a tag constant, gpu, to present graph with GPU support.\r\n* `saved_model.utils` now support SparseTensors transparently.\r\n* A more efficient implementation of non-max suppression.\r\n* Add support for the shrinkage-type L2 to FtrlOptimizer in addition to the online L2 it already supports.\r\n* Fix negative variance in moments calculation.\r\n* Expand UniqueOp Benchmark Tests to cover more collision cases.\r\n* Improves stability of GCS filesystem on Mac.\r\n* Add time estimation to HloCostAnalysis.\r\n* Fixed the bug in Estimator that params in constructor was not a deepcopy of the user provided one. This bugs inadvertently enabled user to mutate the params after the creation of Estimator, leading to potentially undefined behavior.\r\n* Added None check for save_path in `saver.restore`.\r\n* Register devices under their legacy names in device_mgr to ease the transition to clusterspec-propagated configurations.\r\n* VectorExponential added to distributions.\r\n* Add a bitwise module with bitwise_and, bitwise_or, bitwise_xor, and invert functions.\r\n* Add fixed-grid ODE integration routines.\r\n* Allow passing bounds to ScipyOptimizerInterface.\r\n* Correctness fixes for fft_length parameter to `tf.spectral.rfft` & `tf.spectral.irfft`.\r\n* Exported model signatures using the 'predict' method will no longer have their input and output keys silently ignored and rewritten to 'inputs' and 'outputs'. If a model was exported with different names before 1.2, and is now served with tensorflow/serving, it will accept requests using 'inputs' and 'outputs'. Starting at 1.2, such a model will accept the keys specified during export. Therefore, inference requests using 'inputs' and 'outputs' may start to fail. To fix this, either update any inference clients to send requests with the actual input and output keys used by the trainer code, or conversely, update the trainer code to name the input and output Tensors 'inputs' and 'outputs', respectively. Signatures using the 'classify' and 'regress' methods are not affected by this change; they will continue to standardize their input and output keys as before.\r\n* Add in-memory caching to the Dataset API.\r\n* Set default end_of_sequence variable in datasets iterators to false.\r\n* [Performance] Increase performance of `tf.layers.con2d` when setting use_bias=True by 2x by using nn.bias_add.\r\n* Update iOS examples to use CocoaPods, and moved to tensorflow/examples/ios.\r\n* Adds a family= attribute in `tf.summary` ops to allow controlling the tab name used in Tensorboard for organizing summaries.\r\n* When GPU is configured, do not require --config=cuda, instead, automatically build for GPU if this is requested in the configure script.\r\n* Fix incorrect sampling of small probabilities in CPU/GPU multinomial.\r\n* Add a list_devices() API on sessions to list devices within a cluster.

    "body": "# Release 1.3.0\r\n\r\n## Major Features and Improvements\r\n* Added canned estimators to Tensorflow library. List of added estimators: `DNNClassifier`, `DNNRegressor`, `LinearClassifer`, `LinearRegressor`, `DNNLinearCombinedClassifier`, `DNNLinearCombinedRegressor`.\r\n* All our prebuilt binaries have been built with cuDNN 6.\r\n* Adds a file cache to the GCS filesystem with configurable max staleness for file contents. This permits caching of file contents across close/open boundaries.\r\n* Added an axis parameter to `tf.gather`.\r\n* Added a `constant_values` keyword argument to `tf.pad`.\r\n* Adds `Dataset.interleave` transformation.\r\n* Add `ConcatenateDataset` to concatenate two datasets.\r\n* Added Mobilenet support to TensorFlow for Poets training script.\r\n* Adds a block cache to the GCS filesystem with configurable block size and count.\r\n* SinhArcSinh bijector added.\r\n* Added `Dataset.list_files` API.\r\n* Introduces new operations and Python bindings for the Cloud TPU.\r\n* Adding TensorFlow-iOS CocoaPod for symmetry with tensorflow-android.\r\n* Introduces base implementations of ClusterResolvers.\r\n* Unify memory representations of TensorShape and PartialTensorShape. As a consequence, tensors now have a maximum of 254 dimensions, not 255.\r\n* Changed references to LIBXSMM to use version 1.8.1.\r\n* TensorFlow Debugger (tfdbg): Display summaries of numeric tensor values with the `-s` flag to command `print_tensor` or `pt`.\r\n* Initial release of the statistical distribution library `tf.distributions`.\r\n* GPU kernels and speed improvements for for unary `tf.where` and `tf.nn.top_k`.\r\n* Monotonic Attention wrappers added to `tf.contrib.seq2seq`.\r\n\r\n## Breaking Changes to the API\r\n* `tf.RewriterConfig` was removed from the Python API after being available in 1.2 release candidates (it was never in an actual release). Graph rewriting is still available, just not as `tf.RewriterConfig`. Instead add an explicit import.\r\n* Breaking change to `tf.contrib.data.Dataset` APIs that expect a nested structure. Lists are now converted to `tf.Tensor` implicitly. You may need to change uses of lists to tuples in existing code. In addition, dicts are now supported as a nested structure.\r\n\r\n## Changes to contrib APIs\r\n* Adds tf.contrib.nn.rank_sampled_softmax_loss, a sampled-softmax variant that can improve rank loss.\r\n* `tf.contrib.metrics`.{streaming_covariance,streaming_pearson_correlation} modified to return nan when they have seen less or equal to 1 unit of weight.\r\n* Adds time series models to contrib. See contrib/timeseries/README.md for details.\r\n* Adds FULLY_CONNECTED Op to tensorflow/contrib/lite/schema.fbs\r\n\r\n## Bug Fixes and Other Changes\r\n* Fixes 'strides' and 'begin' dtype mismatch when slicing using int64 Tensor index in python.\r\n* Improved convolution padding documentation.\r\n* Add a tag constant, gpu, to present graph with GPU support.\r\n* `saved_model.utils` now support SparseTensors transparently.\r\n* A more efficient implementation of non-max suppression.\r\n* Add support for the shrinkage-type L2 to FtrlOptimizer in addition to the online L2 it already supports.\r\n* Fix negative variance in moments calculation.\r\n* Expand UniqueOp Benchmark Tests to cover more collision cases.\r\n* Improves stability of GCS filesystem on Mac.\r\n* Add time estimation to HloCostAnalysis.\r\n* Fixed the bug in Estimator that params in constructor was not a deepcopy of the user provided one. This bugs inadvertently enabled user to mutate the params after the creation of Estimator, leading to potentially undefined behavior.\r\n* Added None check for save_path in `saver.restore`.\r\n* Register devices under their legacy names in device_mgr to ease the transition to clusterspec-propagated configurations.\r\n* VectorExponential added to distributions.\r\n* Add a bitwise module with bitwise_and, bitwise_or, bitwise_xor, and invert functions.\r\n* Add fixed-grid ODE integration routines.\r\n* Allow passing bounds to ScipyOptimizerInterface.\r\n* Correctness fixes for fft_length parameter to `tf.spectral.rfft` & `tf.spectral.irfft`.\r\n* Exported model signatures using the 'predict' method will no longer have their input and output keys silently ignored and rewritten to 'inputs' and 'outputs'. If a model was exported with different names before 1.2, and is now served with tensorflow/serving, it will accept requests using 'inputs' and 'outputs'. Starting at 1.2, such a model will accept the keys specified during export. Therefore, inference requests using 'inputs' and 'outputs' may start to fail. To fix this, either update any inference clients to send requests with the actual input and output keys used by the trainer code, or conversely, update the trainer code to name the input and output Tensors 'inputs' and 'outputs', respectively. Signatures using the 'classify' and 'regress' methods are not affected by this change; they will continue to standardize their input and output keys as before.\r\n* Add in-memory caching to the Dataset API.\r\n* Set default end_of_sequence variable in datasets iterators to false.\r\n* [Performance] Increase performance of `tf.layers.con2d` when setting use_bias=True by 2x by using nn.bias_add.\r\n* Update iOS examples to use CocoaPods, and moved to tensorflow/examples/ios.\r\n* Adds a family= attribute in `tf.summary` ops to allow controlling the tab name used in Tensorboard for organizing summaries.\r\n* When GPU is configured, do not require --config=cuda, instead, automatically build for GPU if this is requested in the configure script.\r\n* Fix incorrect sampling of small probabilities in CPU/GPU multinomial.\r\n* Add a list_devices() API on sessions to list devices within a cluster. Additionally, this change augment the ListDevices master API to support specifying a session.\r\n* Allow uses of over-parameterized separable convolution.\r\n* TensorForest multi-regression bug fix.\r\n* Framework now supports armv7, cocoapods.org now displays correct page.\r\n* Script to create iOS framework for CocoaPods.\r\n* Android releases of TensorFlow are now pushed to jcenter for easier integration into apps. See https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/contrib/android/README.md for more details.\r\n* Fixed a bug that prevented tfdbg from functioning with multi-GPU setups.\r\n* Fixed a bug that prevented tfdbg from working with `tf.Session.make_callable`.\r\n\r\n## Thanks to our Contributors\r\n\r\nThis release contains contributions from many people at Google, as well as:\r\n\r\n4F2E4A2E, Adriano Carmezim, Adrià Arrufat, Alan Yee, Alex Lattas, Alex Rothberg,\r\nAlexandr Baranezky, Ali Siddiqui, Andreas Solleder, Andrei Costinescu, Andrew Hundt,\r\nAndrobin, Andy Kernahan, Anish Shah, Anthony Platanios, Arvinds-Ds, b1rd, Baptiste\r\nArnaud, Ben Mabey, Benedikt Linse, Beomsu Kim, Bo Wang, Boyuan Deng, Brett Koonce,\r\nBruno Rosa, Carl Thomé, Changming Sun, Chase Roberts, Chirag Bhatia, Chris Antaki,\r\nChris Hoyean Song, Chris Tava, Christos Nikolaou, Croath Liu, cxx, Czxck001, Daniel\r\nYlitalo, Danny Goodman, Darren Garvey, David Brailovsky, David Norman, DavidNorman,\r\ndavidpham87, ddurham2, Dhruv, DimanNe, Drew Hintz, Dustin Tran, Earthson Lu, ethiraj,\r\nFabian Winnen, Fei Sun, Freedom\" Koan-Sin Tan, Fritz Obermeyer, Gao, Xiang, Gautam,\r\nGuenther Schmuelling, Gyu-Ho Lee, Hauke Brammer, horance, Humanity123, J Alammar,\r\nJayeol Chun, Jeroen BéDorf, Jianfei Wang, jiefangxuanyan, Jing Jun Yin, Joan Puigcerver,\r\nJoel Hestness, Johannes Mayer, John Lawson, Johnson145, Jon Malmaud, Jonathan Alvarez-Gutierrez,\r\nJuang, Yi-Lin, Julian Viereck, Kaarthik Sivashanmugam, Karl Lessard, karl@kubx.ca, Kevin\r\nCarbone, Kevin Van Der Burgt, Kongsea, ksellesk, lanhin, Lef Ioannidis, Liangliang He,\r\nLouis Tiao, Luke Iwanski, LáSzló Csomor, magixsno, Mahmoud Abuzaina, Marcel Hlopko, Mark\r\nNeumann, Maxwell Paul Brickner, mdfaijul, MichaëL Defferrard, Michał JastrzęBski, Michele\r\nColombo, Mike Brodie, Mosnoi Ion, mouradmourafiq, myPrecious, Nayana Thorat,\r\nNeeraj Kashyap, Nelson Liu, Niranjan Hasabnis, Olivier Moindrot, orome, Pankaj Gupta, Paul\r\nVan Eck, peeyush18, Peng Yu, Pierre, preciousdp11, qjivy, Raingo, raoqiyu, ribx, Richard S.\r\nImaoka, Rishabh Patel, Robert Walecki, Rockford Wei, Ryan Kung, Sahil Dua, Sandip Giri, Sayed\r\nHadi Hashemi, sgt101, Shitian Ni, Shuolongbj, Siim PõDer, Simon Perkins, sj6077, SOLARIS,\r\nSpotlight0xff, Steffen Eberbach, Stephen Fox, superryanguo, Sven Mayer, Tapan Prakash,\r\nTiago Morais Morgado, Till Hoffmann, Tj Rana, Vadim Markovtsev, vhasanov, Wei Wu,\r\nwindead, Yan (Asta) Li, Yan Chen, Yann Henon, Yi Wang, Yong Tang, yorkie, Yuan (Terry)\r\nTang, Yuxin Wu, zhengjiajin, zhongzyd, 黄璞\r\n\r\nWe are also grateful to all who filed issues or helped resolve them, asked and\r\nanswered questions, and were part of inspiring discussions."

    "body": "# Release 1.2.0\r\n\r\n## Major Features and Improvements\r\n* Python 3.6 support on Windows.\r\n* Added `tf.layers.conv3d_transpose` layer for spatio temporal deconvolution.\r\n* Added `tf.Session.make_callable()`, which provides a lower overhead means of running a similar step multiple times.\r\n* Added ibverbs-based RDMA support to contrib (courtesy @junshi15 from Yahoo).\r\n* `RNNCell` objects now subclass `tf.layers.Layer`.  The strictness described\r\n  in the TensorFlow 1.1 release is gone:  The first time an RNNCell is used,\r\n  it caches its scope.  All future uses of the RNNCell will reuse variables from\r\n  that same scope.  This is a breaking change from the behavior of RNNCells\r\n  in TensorFlow versions <= 1.0.1.  TensorFlow 1.1 had checks in place to\r\n  ensure old code works correctly with the new semantics; this version\r\n  allows more flexible uses of RNNCell but can lead to subtle errors if\r\n  using code meant for TensorFlow <= 1.0.1.  For example, writing:\r\n  `MultiRNNCell([lstm] * 5)` will now build a 5-layer LSTM stack where each\r\n  layer shares the **same** parameters.  To get 5 layers each with their own\r\n  parameters, write: `MultiRNNCell([LSTMCell(...) for _ in range(5)])`.\r\n  If at all unsure, first test your code with TF 1.1; ensure it raises no\r\n  errors, and then upgrade to TF 1.2.\r\n* TensorForest Estimator now supports SavedModel export for serving.\r\n* Support client-provided ClusterSpec's and propagate them to all workers to enable the creation of dynamic TensorFlow clusters.\r\n* TensorFlow C library now available for Windows.\r\n* We released a new open-source version of TensorBoard.\r\n* [`SavedModel CLI`](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/master/programmers_guide/saved_model_cli) tool available to inspect and execute MetaGraph in SavedModel\r\n* Android releases of TensorFlow are now pushed to jcenter for easier\r\n  integration into apps. See\r\n  https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/contrib/android/README.md\r\n  for more details.\r\n* RNNCells' variable names have been renamed for consistency with Keras layers.\r\n  Specifically, the previous variable names \"weights\" and \"biases\" have\r\n  been changed to \"kernel\" and \"bias\", respectively.\r\n  This may cause backward incompatibility with regard to your old\r\n  checkpoints containing such RNN cells, in which case you can use the tool\r\n  [checkpoint_convert script](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/contrib/rnn/python/tools/checkpoint_convert.py)\r\n  to convert the variable names in your old checkpoints.\r\n* Many of the RNN functions and classes that were in the `tf.nn` namespace\r\n  before the 1.0 release and which were moved to `tf.contrib.rnn` have now\r\n  been moved back to the core namespace.  This includes\r\n  `RNNCell`, `LSTMCell`, `GRUCell`, and a number of other cells.  These\r\n  now reside in `tf.nn.rnn_cell` (with aliases in `tf.contrib.rnn` for backwards\r\n  compatibility).  The original `tf.nn.rnn` function is now `tf.nn.static_rnn`,\r\n  and the bidirectional static and state saving static rnn functions are also\r\n  now back in the `tf.nn` namespace.\r\n\r\n  Notable exceptions are the `EmbeddingWrapper`, `InputProjectionWrapper` and\r\n  `OutputProjectionWrapper`,  which will slowly be moved to deprecation\r\n  in `tf.contrib.rnn`.  These are inefficient wrappers that should often\r\n  be replaced by calling `embedding_lookup` or `layers.dense` as pre- or post-\r\n  processing of the rnn.  For RNN decoding, this functionality has been replaced\r\n  with an alternative API in `tf.contrib.seq2seq`.\r\n* Intel MKL Integration (https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/tensorflow-optimizations-on-modern-intel-architecture). Intel developed a number of\r\n  optimized deep learning primitives: In addition to matrix multiplication and\r\n  convolution, these building blocks include:\r\n  Direct batched convolution\r\n  Pooling: maximum, minimum, average\r\n  Normalization: LRN, batch normalization\r\n  Activation: rectified linear unit (ReLU)\r\n  Data manipulation: multi-dimensional transposition (conversion), split,\r\n  concat, sum and scale.\r\n\r\n## Deprecations\r\n\r\n* TensorFlow 1.2 may be the last time we build with cuDNN 5.1.

    "body": "# Release 1.2.0\r\n\r\n## Major Features and Improvements\r\n* Python 3.6 support on Windows.\r\n* Added `tf.layers.conv3d_transpose` layer for spatio temporal deconvolution.\r\n* Added `tf.Session.make_callable()`, which provides a lower overhead means of running a similar step multiple times.\r\n* Added ibverbs-based RDMA support to contrib (courtesy @junshi15 from Yahoo).\r\n* `RNNCell` objects now subclass `tf.layers.Layer`.  The strictness described\r\n  in the TensorFlow 1.1 release is gone:  The first time an RNNCell is used,\r\n  it caches its scope.  All future uses of the RNNCell will reuse variables from\r\n  that same scope.  This is a breaking change from the behavior of RNNCells\r\n  in TensorFlow versions <= 1.0.1.  TensorFlow 1.1 had checks in place to\r\n  ensure old code works correctly with the new semantics; this version\r\n  allows more flexible uses of RNNCell but can lead to subtle errors if\r\n  using code meant for TensorFlow <= 1.0.1.  For example, writing:\r\n  `MultiRNNCell([lstm] * 5)` will now build a 5-layer LSTM stack where each\r\n  layer shares the **same** parameters.  To get 5 layers each with their own\r\n  parameters, write: `MultiRNNCell([LSTMCell(...) for _ in range(5)])`.\r\n  If at all unsure, first test your code with TF 1.1; ensure it raises no\r\n  errors, and then upgrade to TF 1.2.\r\n* TensorForest Estimator now supports SavedModel export for serving.\r\n* Support client-provided ClusterSpec's and propagate them to all workers to enable the creation of dynamic TensorFlow clusters.\r\n* TensorFlow C library now available for Windows.\r\n* We released a new open-source version of TensorBoard.\r\n* [`SavedModel CLI`](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/master/programmers_guide/saved_model_cli) tool available to inspect and execute MetaGraph in SavedModel\r\n* Android releases of TensorFlow are now pushed to jcenter for easier\r\n  integration into apps. See\r\n  https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/contrib/android/README.md\r\n  for more details.\r\n* RNNCells' variable names have been renamed for consistency with Keras layers.\r\n  Specifically, the previous variable names \"weights\" and \"biases\" have\r\n  been changed to \"kernel\" and \"bias\", respectively.\r\n  This may cause backward incompatibility with regard to your old\r\n  checkpoints containing such RNN cells, in which case you can use the tool\r\n  [checkpoint_convert script](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/contrib/rnn/python/tools/checkpoint_convert.py)\r\n  to convert the variable names in your old checkpoints.\r\n* Many of the RNN functions and classes that were in the `tf.nn` namespace\r\n  before the 1.0 release and which were moved to `tf.contrib.rnn` have now\r\n  been moved back to the core namespace.  This includes\r\n  `RNNCell`, `LSTMCell`, `GRUCell`, and a number of other cells.  These\r\n  now reside in `tf.nn.rnn_cell` (with aliases in `tf.contrib.rnn` for backwards\r\n  compatibility).  The original `tf.nn.rnn` function is now `tf.nn.static_rnn`,\r\n  and the bidirectional static and state saving static rnn functions are also\r\n  now back in the `tf.nn` namespace.\r\n\r\n  Notable exceptions are the `EmbeddingWrapper`, `InputProjectionWrapper` and\r\n  `OutputProjectionWrapper`,  which will slowly be moved to deprecation\r\n  in `tf.contrib.rnn`.  These are inefficient wrappers that should often\r\n  be replaced by calling `embedding_lookup` or `layers.dense` as pre- or post-\r\n  processing of the rnn.  For RNN decoding, this functionality has been replaced\r\n  with an alternative API in `tf.contrib.seq2seq`.\r\n* Intel MKL Integration (https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/tensorflow-optimizations-on-modern-intel-architecture).

Starting with\r\n  TensorFlow 1.3, we will try to build all our prebuilt binaries with cuDNN 6.0.\r\n  While we will try to keep our source code compatible with cuDNN 5.1, it will\r\n  be best effort.\r\n\r\n## Breaking Changes to the API\r\n* `org.tensorflow.contrib.android.TensorFlowInferenceInterface` now throws exceptions where possible and has simplified method signatures.\r\n\r\n## Changes to contrib APIs\r\n* Added `tf.contrib.util.create_example`.\r\n* Added bilinear interpolation to `tf.contrib.image`.\r\n* Add `tf.contrib.stateless` for random ops with custom seed control.\r\n* MultivariateNormalFullCovariance added to contrib/distributions/\r\n* tensorflow/contrib/rnn undergoes RNN cell variable renaming for\r\n  consistency with Keras layers. Specifically, the previous variable names\r\n  \"weights\" and \"biases\" are changed to \"kernel\" and \"bias\", respectively.\r\n  This may cause backward incompatibility with regard to your old\r\n  checkpoints containing such RNN cells, in which case you can use the\r\n  [checkpoint_convert script](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/contrib/rnn/python/tools/checkpoint_convert.py)\r\n  to convert the variable names in your old checkpoints.\r\n\r\n## Bug Fixes and Other Changes\r\n* In python, `Operation.get_attr` on type attributes returns the Python DType\r\n  version of the type to match expected get_attr documentation rather than the\r\n  protobuf enum.\r\n* Changed MIN_SDK version to 8.0 when building iOS libraries.\r\n* Fixed LIBXSMM integration.\r\n* Make decode_jpeg/decode_png/decode_gif handle all formats, since users frequently try to decode an image as the wrong type.\r\n* Improve implicit broadcasting lowering.\r\n* Improving stability of GCS/Bigquery clients by a faster retrying of stale transmissions.\r\n* Remove OpKernelConstruction::op_def() as part of minimizing proto dependencies.\r\n* VectorLaplaceDiag distribution added.\r\n* Android demo no longer requires libtensorflow_demo.so to run (libtensorflow_inference.so still required)\r\n* Added `categorical_column_with_vocabulary_file`.\r\n* Introduce ops for batching/unbatching tensors across Session::Run() calls.\r\n* Add tf.log_sigmoid(x) = tf.log(tf.sigmoid(x)) = -tf.nn.softplus(-x).\r\n* Changed hooks lists to immutable tuples, and now allow any iterable for the associated arguments.\r\n* Introduce TFDecorator.\r\n* Added an Mfcc op for speech feature generation.\r\n* Improved DirectSession::Run() overhead and error checking. Feeding a value of the wrong type will now synchronously raise an INVALID_ARGUMENT error instead of asynchronously raising an INTERNAL error. Code that depends on the (undefined) behavior when feeding a tensor of the wrong type may need to be updated.\r\n* Added unreduced NONE, and reduced MEAN options for losses. Removed \"WEIGHTED_\" prefix from other Reduction constants.\r\n* assertAllClose now handles dicts.\r\n* Added Gmock matcher for HloInstructions.\r\n* Add var name to errors on variable restore.\r\n* Added an AudioSpectrogram op for audio feature generation.\r\n* Added `reduction` arg to losses.\r\n* `tf.placeholder` can represent scalar shapes and partially known.\r\n* Remove estimator_spec(mode) argument.\r\n* Added an AudioSpectrogram op for audio feature generation.\r\n* TensorBoard disables all runs by default if there are more than 40 runs.\r\n* Removed old doc generator code.\r\n* GCS file system integration now supports domain buckets, e.g gs://bucket.domain.com/path.\r\n* Add `tf.summary.text` for outputting text to TensorBoard.\r\n* The \"run\" command of tfdbg's command-line interface now supports filtering of tensors by node name, op type and tensor dtype.\r\n* `tf.string_to_number` now supports int64 and float64 outputs.\r\n\r\n## Thanks to our Contributors\r\n\r\nThis release contains contributions from many people at Google, as well as:\r\n\r\n4F2E4A2E, Aaron Schumacher, Abhi Agg, admcrae, Adriano Carmezim, Adrià Arrufat,\r\nagramesh1, Akimitsu Seo, Alan Mosca, Alex Egg, Alex Rothberg, Alexander Heinecke,\r\nAlexander Matyasko, Alexandr Baranezky, Alexandre Caulier, Ali Siddiqui, Anand Venkat,\r\nAndrew Hundt, Androbin, Anmol Sharma, Arie, Arno Leist, Arron Cao, AuréLien Geron, Bairen Yi,\r\nBeomsu Kim, Carl Thomé, cfperez, Changming Sun, Corey Wharton, critiqjo, Dalei Li, Daniel\r\nRasmussen, Daniel Trebbien, DaríO Hereñú, David Eng, David Norman, David Y.

    "body": "# Release 1.2.0\r\n\r\n## Major Features and Improvements\r\n* Added `tf.layers.conv3d_transpose` layer for spatio temporal deconvolution.\r\n* Added `tf.Session.make_callable()`, which provides a lower overhead means of running a similar step multiple times.\r\n* Added ibverbs-based RDMA support to contrib (courtesy @junshi15 from Yahoo).\r\n* `RNNCell` objects now subclass `tf.layers._Layer`.  The strictness described\r\n  in the TensorFlow 1.1 release is gone:  The first time an RNNCell is used,\r\n  it caches its scope.  All future uses of the RNNCell will reuse variables from\r\n  that same scope.  This is a breaking change from the behavior of RNNCells\r\n  in TensorFlow versions <= 1.0.1.  TensorFlow 1.1 had checks in place to\r\n  ensure old code works correctly with the new semantics; this version\r\n  allows more flexible uses of RNNCell but can lead to subtle errors if\r\n  using code meant for TensorFlow <= 1.0.1.  For example, writing:\r\n  `MultiRNNCell([lstm] * 5)` will now build a 5-layer LSTM stack where each\r\n  layer shares the **same** parameters.  To get 5 layers each with their own\r\n  parameters, write: `MultiRNNCell([LSTMCell(...) for _ in range(5)])`.\r\n  If at all unsure, first test your code with TF 1.1; ensure it raises no\r\n  errors, and then upgrade to TF 1.2.\r\n* TensorForest Estimator now supports SavedModel export for serving.\r\n* Support client-provided ClusterSpec's and propagate them to all workers to enable the creation of dynamic TensorFlow clusters.\r\n* TensorFlow C library now available for Windows.\r\n* We released a new open-source version of TensorBoard.\r\n\r\n## Breaking Changes to the API\r\n* org.tensorflow.contrib.android.TensorFlowInferenceInterface now throws exceptions where possible and has simplified method signatures.\r\n\r\n## Changes to contrib APIs\r\n* Added `tf.contrib.util.create_example`.\r\n* Added bilinear interpolation to tf.contrib.image.\r\n* Add `tf.contrib.stateless` for random ops with custom seed control.\r\n* MultivariateNormalFullCovariance added to contrib/distributions/\r\n\r\n## Bug Fixes and Other Changes\r\n* In python, `Operation.get_attr` on type attributes returns the Python DType\r\n  version of the type to match expected get_attr documentation rather than the\r\n  protobuf enum.\r\n* Changed MIN_SDK version to 8.0 when building iOS libraries.\r\n* Fixed LIBXSMM integration.\r\n* Make decode_jpeg/decode_png/decode_gif handle all formats, since users frequently try to decode an image as the wrong type.\r\n* Improve implicit broadcasting lowering.\r\n* Improving stability of GCS/Bigquery clients by a faster retrying of stale transmissions.\r\n* Remove OpKernelConstruction::op_def() as part of minimizing proto dependencies.\r\n* VectorLaplaceDiag distribution added.\r\n* Android demo no longer requires libtensorflow_demo.so to run (libtensorflow_inference.so still required)\r\n* Added `categorical_column_with_vocabulary_file`.\r\n* Introduce ops for batching/unbatching tensors across Session::Run() calls.\r\n* Add tf.log_sigmoid(x) = tf.log(tf.sigmoid(x)) = -tf.nn.softplus(-x).\r\n* Changed hooks lists to immutable tuples, and now allow any iterable for the associated arguments.\r\n* Introduce TFDecorator.\r\n* Added an Mfcc op for speech feature generation.\r\n* Improved DirectSession::Run() overhead and error checking.

    "body": "## Major Features and Improvements\n- XLA (experimental): initial release of [XLA](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/master/experimental/xla/), a domain-specific compiler for TensorFlow graphs, that targets CPUs and GPUs.\n- TensorFlow Debugger (tfdbg): command-line interface and API.\n- New python 3 docker images added.\n- Made pip packages pypi compliant. TensorFlow can now be installed by `pip\n  install tensorflow` command.\n- Several python API calls have been changed to resemble NumPy more closely.\n- New (experimental) [Java API](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tensorflow/java).\n- Android: new person detection + tracking demo implementing \"Scalable Object Detection using Deep Neural Networks\" (with additional YOLO object detector support)\n- Android: new camera-based image stylization demo based on \"A Learned Representation For Artistic Style\"\n\n## Breaking Changes to the API\n\nTo help you upgrade your existing TensorFlow Python code to match the API changes below, we have prepared a [conversion script](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/r1.0/tensorflow/tools/compatibility).\n- TensorFlow/models have been moved to a separate github repository.\n- Division and modulus operators (/, //, %) now match Python (flooring)\n  semantics. This applies to `tf.div` and `tf.mod` as well. To obtain forced\n  integer truncation based behaviors you can use `tf.truncatediv`\n  and `tf.truncatemod`.\n- `tf.divide()` is now the recommended division function. `tf.div()` will\n  remain, but its semantics do not respond to Python 3 or `from future`\n  mechanisms.\n- tf.reverse() now takes indices of axes to be reversed. E.g.\n  `tf.reverse(a, [True, False, True])` must now be written as\n  `tf.reverse(a, [0, 2])`. `tf.reverse_v2()` will remain until 1.0 final.\n- `tf.mul`, `tf.sub` and `tf.neg` are deprecated in favor of `tf.multiply`,\n  `tf.subtract` and `tf.negative`.\n- `tf.pack` and `tf.unpack` are deprecated in favor of `tf.stack` and\n  `tf.unstack`.\n- `TensorArray.pack` and `TensorArray.unpack` are getting deprecated in favor of\n  `TensorArray.stack` and `TensorArray.unstack`.\n- The following Python functions have had their arguments changed to use `axis`\n  when referring to specific dimensions. We have kept the old keyword arguments\n  for compatibility currently, but we will be removing them well before the\n  final 1.0.\n  - `tf.argmax`: `dimension` becomes `axis`\n  - `tf.argmin`: `dimension` becomes `axis`\n  - `tf.count_nonzero`: `reduction_indices` becomes `axis`\n  - `tf.expand_dims`: `dim` becomes `axis`\n  - `tf.reduce_all`: `reduction_indices` becomes `axis`\n  - `tf.reduce_any`: `reduction_indices` becomes `axis`\n  - `tf.reduce_join`: `reduction_indices` becomes `axis`\n  - `tf.reduce_logsumexp`: `reduction_indices` becomes `axis`\n  - `tf.reduce_max`: `reduction_indices` becomes `axis`\n  - `tf.reduce_mean`: `reduction_indices` becomes `axis`\n  - `tf.reduce_min`: `reduction_indices` becomes `axis`\n  - `tf.reduce_prod`: `reduction_indices` becomes `axis`\n  - `tf.reduce_sum`: `reduction_indices` becomes `axis`\n  - `tf.reverse_sequence`: `batch_dim` becomes `batch_axis`, `seq_dim` becomes `seq_axis`\n  - `tf.sparse_concat`: `concat_dim` becomes `axis`\n  - `tf.sparse_reduce_sum`: `reduction_axes` becomes `axis`\n  - `tf.sparse_reduce_sum_sparse`: `reduction_axes` becomes `axis`\n  - `tf.sparse_split`: `split_dim` becomes `axis`\n- `tf.listdiff` has been renamed to `tf.setdiff1d` to match NumPy naming.\n- `tf.inv` has been renamed to be `tf.reciprocal` (component-wise reciprocal)\n  to avoid confusion with `np.inv` which is matrix inversion\n- tf.round now uses banker's rounding (round to even) semantics to match NumPy.\n- `tf.split` now takes arguments in a reversed order and with different\n  keywords. In particular, we now match NumPy order as\n  `tf.split(value, num_or_size_splits, axis)`.\n- `tf.sparse_split` now takes arguments in reversed order and with different\n  keywords. In particular we now match NumPy order as\n  `tf.sparse_split(sp_input, num_split, axis)`. NOTE: we have temporarily\n  made `tf.sparse_split` require keyword arguments.\n- `tf.concat` now takes arguments in reversed order and with different keywords. In particular we now match NumPy order as `tf.concat(values, axis, name)`.\n- `tf.image.decode_jpeg` by default uses the faster DCT method, sacrificing\n  a little fidelity for improved speed. One can revert to the old\n  behavior by specifying the attribute `dct_method='INTEGER_ACCURATE'`.\n- `tf.complex_abs` has been removed from the Python interface. `tf.abs`\n  supports complex tensors and should be used instead.\n- Template.`var_scope` property renamed to `.variable_scope`\n- SyncReplicasOptimizer is removed and SyncReplicasOptimizerV2 renamed to SyncReplicasOptimizer.\n- `tf.zeros_initializer()` and `tf.ones_initializer()` now return a callable\n  that must be called with initializer arguments, in your code replace\n  `tf.zeros_initializer` with `tf.zeros_initializer()`.\n- `SparseTensor.shape` has been renamed to `SparseTensor.dense_shape`.  Same for\n  `SparseTensorValue.shape`.\n- Replace tf.scalar_summary, tf.histogram_summary, tf.audio_summary, tf.image_summary with tf.summary.scalar, tf.summary.histogram, tf.summary.audio, tf.summary.image, respectively. The new summary ops take name rather than tag as their first argument, meaning summary ops now respect TensorFlow name scopes.\n- Replace tf.train.SummaryWriter and tf.train.SummaryWriterCache with tf.summary.FileWriter and tf.summary.FileWriterCache. \n- Removes RegisterShape from public API. Use C++ shape function registration\n  instead.\n- Deprecated `_ref` dtypes from the python API.\n- In the C++ API (in tensorflow/cc), Input, Output, etc. have moved\n  from the tensorflow::ops namespace to tensorflow.\n- Change arg order for `{softmax,sparse_softmax,sigmoid}_cross_entropy_with_logits` to be (labels, predictions), and force use of named args.\n- tf.nn.rnn_cell.\\* and most functions in tf.nn.rnn.\\* (with the exception of dynamic_rnn and raw_rnn) are temporarily in tf.contrib.rnn.  They will be moved back into core for TF 1.1.\n\n## Bug Fixes and Other Changes\n- Numerous C++ API updates.\n- New op: `parallel_stack`.\n- Introducing common tf io compression options constants for\n  RecordReader/RecordWriter.\n- Add `sparse_column_with_vocabulary_file`, to specify a feature column that\n  transform string features to IDs, where the mapping is defined by a vocabulary\n  file.\n- Added `index_to_string_table` which returns a lookup table that maps indices to\n  strings.\n- Add `string_to_index_table`, which returns a lookup table that matches strings\n  to indices.\n- Add a `ParallelForWithWorkerId` function.\n- Add `string_to_index_table`, which returns a lookup table that matches strings\n  to indices.\n- Support restore session from checkpoint files in v2 in `contrib/session_bundle`.\n- Added a tf.contrib.image.rotate function for arbitrary angles.\n- Added `tf.contrib.framework.filter_variables` as a convenience function to\n  filter lists of variables based on regular expressions.\n- `make_template()` takes an optional `custom_getter_ param`.\n- Added comment about how existing directories are handled by\n  `recursive_create_dir`.\n- Added an op for QR factorizations.\n- Divides and mods in Python API now use flooring (Python) semantics.\n- Android: pre-built libs are now built nightly.\n- Android: cmake/gradle build for TensorFlow Inference library under\n  `contrib/android/cmake`\n- Android: Much more robust Session initialization code.\n- Android: TF stats now exposed directly in demo and log when debug mode is\n  active\n- Android: new/better README.md documentation\n- saved_model is available as `tf.saved_model`.\n- Empty op is now stateful.\n- Improve speed of scatter_update on the cpu for ASSIGN operations.\n- Change `reduce_join` to treat `reduction_indices` in the same way as other `reduce_` ops.\n- Move `TensorForestEstimator` to `contrib/tensor_forest`.\n- Enable compiler optimizations by default and allow configuration in configure.\n- `tf.divide` now honors the name field.\n- Make metrics weight broadcasting more strict.\n- Add new queue-like `StagingArea` and new ops: `stage` and `unstage`.\n- Enable inplace update ops for strings on CPU. Speed up string concat.\n\n## Thanks to our Contributors\n\nThis release contains contributions from many people at Google, as well as:\n\nAaron Hu, Abhishek Aggarwal, Adam Michael, Adriano Carmezim, @AfirSraftGarrier,\nAlexander Novikov, Alexander Rosenberg Johansen, Andrew Gibiansky, Andrew Hundt,\nAnish Shah, Anton Loss, @b0noI, @BoyuanJiang, Carl Thomé, Chad Kennedy, Comic\nChang, Connor Braa, Daniel N.

    "body": "## Major Features and Improvements\n- XLA (experimental): initial release of [XLA](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/master/experimental/xla/), a domain-specific compiler for TensorFlow graphs, that targets CPUs and GPUs.\n- TensorFlow Debugger (tfdbg): command-line interface and API.\n- New python 3 docker images added.\n- Made pip packages pypi compliant. TensorFlow can now be installed by `pip\n  install tensorflow` command.\n- Several python API calls have been changed to resemble NumPy more closely.\n- New (experimental) [Java API](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tensorflow/java).\n- Android: new person detection + tracking demo implementing \"Scalable Object Detection using Deep Neural Networks\" (with additional YOLO object detector support)\n- Android: new camera-based image stylization demo based on \"A Learned Representation For Artistic Style\"\n\n## Breaking Changes to the API\n\nTo help you upgrade your existing TensorFlow Python code to match the API changes below, we have prepared a [conversion script](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/r1.0/tensorflow/tools/compatibility).\n- TensorFlow/models have been moved to a separate github repository.\n- Division and modulus operators (/, //, %) now match Python (flooring)\n  semantics. This applies to `tf.div` and `tf.mod` as well. To obtain forced\n  integer truncation based behaviors you can use `tf.truncatediv`\n  and `tf.truncatemod`.\n- `tf.divide()` is now the recommended division function. `tf.div()` will\n  remain, but its semantics do not respond to Python 3 or `from future`\n  mechanisms.\n- tf.reverse() now takes indices of axes to be reversed. E.g.\n  `tf.reverse(a, [True, False, True])` must now be written as\n  `tf.reverse(a, [0, 2])`. `tf.reverse_v2()` will remain until 1.0 final.\n- `tf.mul`, `tf.sub` and `tf.neg` are deprecated in favor of `tf.multiply`,\n  `tf.subtract` and `tf.negative`.\n- `tf.pack` and `tf.unpack` are deprecated in favor of `tf.stack` and\n  `tf.unstack`.\n- `TensorArray.pack` and `TensorArray.unpack` are getting deprecated in favor of\n  `TensorArray.stack` and `TensorArray.unstack`.\n- The following Python functions have had their arguments changed to use `axis`\n  when referring to specific dimensions. We have kept the old keyword arguments\n  for compatibility currently, but we will be removing them well before the\n  final 1.0.\n  - `tf.argmax`: `dimension` becomes `axis`\n  - `tf.argmin`: `dimension` becomes `axis`\n  - `tf.count_nonzero`: `reduction_indices` becomes `axis`\n  - `tf.expand_dims`: `dim` becomes `axis`\n  - `tf.reduce_all`: `reduction_indices` becomes `axis`\n  - `tf.reduce_any`: `reduction_indices` becomes `axis`\n  - `tf.reduce_join`: `reduction_indices` becomes `axis`\n  - `tf.reduce_logsumexp`: `reduction_indices` becomes `axis`\n  - `tf.reduce_max`: `reduction_indices` becomes `axis`\n  - `tf.reduce_mean`: `reduction_indices` becomes `axis`\n  - `tf.reduce_min`: `reduction_indices` becomes `axis`\n  - `tf.reduce_prod`: `reduction_indices` becomes `axis`\n  - `tf.reduce_sum`: `reduction_indices` becomes `axis`\n  - `tf.reverse_sequence`: `batch_dim` becomes `batch_axis`, `seq_dim` becomes `seq_axis`\n  - `tf.sparse_concat`: `concat_dim` becomes `axis`\n  - `tf.sparse_reduce_sum`: `reduction_axes` becomes `axis`\n  - `tf.sparse_reduce_sum_sparse`: `reduction_axes` becomes `axis`\n  - `tf.sparse_split`: `split_dim` becomes `axis`\n- `tf.listdiff` has been renamed to `tf.setdiff1d` to match NumPy naming.\n- `tf.inv` has been renamed to be `tf.reciprocal` (component-wise reciprocal)\n  to avoid confusion with `np.inv` which is matrix inversion\n- tf.round now uses banker's rounding (round to even) semantics to match NumPy.\n- `tf.split` now takes arguments in a reversed order and with different\n  keywords. In particular, we now match NumPy order as\n  `tf.split(value, num_or_size_splits, axis)`.\n- `tf.sparse_split` now takes arguments in reversed order and with different\n  keywords.

    "body": "## Major Features and Improvements\n- XLA (experimental): initial release of [XLA](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/master/experimental/xla/), a domain-specific compiler for TensorFlow graphs, that targets CPUs and GPUs.\n- TensorFlow Debugger (tfdbg): command-line interface and API.\n- New python 3 docker images added.\n- Made pip packages pypi compliant. TensorFlow can now be installed by `pip\n  install tensorflow` command.\n- Several python API calls have been changed to resemble NumPy more closely.\n- New (experimental) [Java API](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tensorflow/java).\n- Android: new person detection + tracking demo implementing \"Scalable Object Detection using Deep Neural Networks\" (with additional YOLO object detector support)\n- Android: new camera-based image stylization demo based on \"A Learned Representation For Artistic Style\"\n\n## Breaking Changes to the API\n\nTo help you upgrade your existing TensorFlow Python code to match the API changes below, we have prepared a [conversion script](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tensorflow/tools/compatibility).\n- TensorFlow/models have been moved to a separate github repository.\n- Division and modulus operators (/, //, %) now match Python (flooring)\n  semantics. This applies to `tf.div` and `tf.mod` as well. To obtain forced\n  integer truncation based behaviors you can use `tf.truncatediv`\n  and `tf.truncatemod`.\n- `tf.divide()` is now the recommended division function. `tf.div()` will\n  remain, but its semantics do not respond to Python 3 or `from future`\n  mechanisms.\n- tf.reverse() now takes indices of axes to be reversed. E.g.\n  `tf.reverse(a, [True, False, True])` must now be written as\n  `tf.reverse(a, [0, 2])`. `tf.reverse_v2()` will remain until 1.0 final.\n- `tf.mul`, `tf.sub` and `tf.neg` are deprecated in favor of `tf.multiply`,\n  `tf.subtract` and `tf.negative`.\n- `tf.pack` and `tf.unpack` are deprecated in favor of `tf.stack` and\n  `tf.unstack`.\n- `TensorArray.pack` and `TensorArray.unpack` are getting deprecated in favor of\n  `TensorArray.stack` and `TensorArray.unstack`.\n- The following Python functions have had their arguments changed to use `axis`\n  when referring to specific dimensions. We have kept the old keyword arguments\n  for compatibility currently, but we will be removing them well before the\n  final 1.0.\n  - `tf.argmax`: `dimension` becomes `axis`\n  - `tf.argmin`: `dimension` becomes `axis`\n  - `tf.count_nonzero`: `reduction_indices` becomes `axis`\n  - `tf.expand_dims`: `dim` becomes `axis`\n  - `tf.reduce_all`: `reduction_indices` becomes `axis`\n  - `tf.reduce_any`: `reduction_indices` becomes `axis`\n  - `tf.reduce_join`: `reduction_indices` becomes `axis`\n  - `tf.reduce_logsumexp`: `reduction_indices` becomes `axis`\n  - `tf.reduce_max`: `reduction_indices` becomes `axis`\n  - `tf.reduce_mean`: `reduction_indices` becomes `axis`\n  - `tf.reduce_min`: `reduction_indices` becomes `axis`\n  - `tf.reduce_prod`: `reduction_indices` becomes `axis`\n  - `tf.reduce_sum`: `reduction_indices` becomes `axis`\n  - `tf.reverse_sequence`: `batch_dim` becomes `batch_axis`, `seq_dim` becomes `seq_axis`\n  - `tf.sparse_concat`: `concat_dim` becomes `axis`\n  - `tf.sparse_reduce_sum`: `reduction_axes` becomes `axis`\n  - `tf.sparse_reduce_sum_sparse`: `reduction_axes` becomes `axis`\n  - `tf.sparse_split`: `split_dim` becomes `axis`\n- `tf.listdiff` has been renamed to `tf.setdiff1d` to match NumPy naming.\n- `tf.inv` has been renamed to be `tf.reciprocal` (component-wise reciprocal)\n  to avoid confusion with `np.inv` which is matrix inversion\n- tf.round now uses banker's rounding (round to even) semantics to match NumPy.\n- `tf.split` now takes arguments in a reversed order and with different\n  keywords. In particular, we now match NumPy order as\n  `tf.split(value, num_or_size_splits, axis)`.\n- `tf.sparse_split` now takes arguments in reversed order and with different\n  keywords. In particular we now match NumPy order as\n  `tf.sparse_split(sp_input, num_split, axis)`. NOTE: we have temporarily\n  made `tf.sparse_split` require keyword arguments.\n- `tf.concat` now takes arguments in reversed order and with different keywords. In particular we now match NumPy order as `tf.concat(values, axis, name)`.\n- `tf.image.decode_jpeg` by default uses the faster DCT method, sacrificing\n  a little fidelity for improved speed. One can revert to the old\n  behavior by specifying the attribute `dct_method='INTEGER_ACCURATE'`.\n- `tf.complex_abs` has been removed from the Python interface. `tf.abs`\n  supports complex tensors and should be used instead.\n- Template.`var_scope` property renamed to `.variable_scope`\n- SyncReplicasOptimizer is removed and SyncReplicasOptimizerV2 renamed to SyncReplicasOptimizer.\n- `tf.zeros_initializer()` and `tf.ones_initializer()` now return a callable\n  that must be called with initializer arguments, in your code replace\n  `tf.zeros_initializer` with `tf.zeros_initializer()`.\n- `SparseTensor.shape` has been renamed to `SparseTensor.dense_shape`.  Same for\n  `SparseTensorValue.shape`.\n- Replace tf.scalar_summary, tf.histogram_summary, tf.audio_summary, tf.image_summary with tf.summary.scalar, tf.summary.histogram, tf.summary.audio, tf.summary.image, respectively. The new summary ops take name rather than tag as their first argument, meaning summary ops now respect TensorFlow name scopes.\n- Replace tf.train.SummaryWriter and tf.train.SummaryWriterCache with tf.summary.FileWriter and tf.summary.FileWriterCache. \n- Removes RegisterShape from public API.
